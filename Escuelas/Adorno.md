Título: Adorno The Recovery of Experience.

_Método de Adorno_: Lo encontramos sobre todo en el __Prólogo a Dialéctica Negativa__, títulado: _teoría espiritual de la experiencia_. Su objetivo es exponer _el concepto filosófico de experiencia_. La __dialéctica__, entonces, se entiende en términos de este proyecto. 

En 1931, con su __Antrittsvorlesung__ (Discurso Inaugural), Adorno trataba de elucidar un tipo de lectura en la cual los items partículares (conceptos filosóficos, piezas músicales, obras de arte, objetos sociales) se interpretarian como el _locus_ de un __universal inmanente__. Cada particular se transforma entonces en un __microcosmos__, donde cada elemento de tal particular es un código (cypher) que, interpretado apropiadamente, puede revelar aspectos del significado espiritual del particular. La referencia a este tipo de experiencia como _espiritual_ intentaba distinguirse de la noción _empirista_ de experiencia. Lo diferente es que la experiencia espiritual es que.. "the multilayered relations of a thing with other things outside it, and eventually the entirety of its context, are allowed to inform the cognitive significance of that thing".

> Rather than moving from the particular to the general by the abstraction of a common property from the object in question, spiritual experience moves from the particular to the universal by reweaving the threads of significance that link the object to its context. The universal is not brought to bear as a classification of the particular (where this implies the abstraction of a common property), it is rather con-structed; the universal is simply the totality formed by the different chains of relational significance that make the object intelligible as the kind of object that it is.


The classifica-tory operation of concepts is essentially the procedure that Kant (1974) describes as “determinate” judgment. Classification involves the subsumption of a particular under a pregiven concept, by treating that particular as an instance of a universal property. The particular is recognized (classified) as exhibiting an ideally detachable characteristic that it potentially shares with other things. Kant contrasts this structure with “reflective” or aesthetic judg-ment, in which judgment has to go in search of the concept, or perhaps even construct a new one, starting from the particular.

The concept, in this case, is dependent on its object in a new and radical sense, because it emerges only through the interrogation of the material qualities of that particular object. This idea provides a useful frame for understanding the structure of spiritual experience. In spiritual experience, the particular is directly the expression of a universal, not an instantiation of a universal property. In other words, the uni-versal is not detachable from the particular as a repeatable property because it is the figure formed by the deciphering of the contextual significance of its elements.

The modern world, for Adorno, is marked pri-marily by a transformation in the structure of experience, a structure that is reflected in the theoretical self-understandings of that world produced by phi-losophy. Adorno tends to describe this structure in terms such as “withered” or “restricted” experience. It is the legacy of that historical process that Max Weber famously described as one of disenchantment.

The usual translation of geistige Erfahrung into English in Adorno's works has been “intellectual experience.”


Adorno began to use the term geistige Erfahrung while working on a series of lectures on Hegel in the late fifties and early sixties, work that Adorno described as “preparation for a revised conception of the dialectic” (1993b, xxxvi). Adorno here speaks of geistige Erfahrung in terms of the “expe-riential substance of Hegel's philosophy,” as opposed to the “experiential con-tent in Hegel's philosophy” (1993b, 54). Whereas the latter would comprise the operation of concepts as the tools of determinate judgment, the former is defined in terms of “the compelling force of the objective phenomena that have been reflected in [Hegel's] philosophy and are sedimented in it.” These phenomena are not present in concepts as their content.


two centrally important features: (1) the experiential substance of concepts must be understood as the historical world; and (2) what a concept expresses is not reducible to the inferential relations it licenses (since what it expresses depends on the concept's proximity to a historical context)

While retaining the basic idea of the earlier Hegel lectures that spiritual experience involves the interpretation of “any and every existing thing as something that is at the same time spiritual [geistig]” (1993b, 57), the lectures on negative dialectic make clear the pivotal role of spiritual experience as a counterconcept to the withering of experience,

and provide more explicit details on how it is supposed to work. Adorno describes spiritual experience as a “spiritualization [Spiritualisierung] of the world” that goes beyond “mere, immediate sensuous experience”


What Adorno saw in positivism was, in a literal sense, the withering of experience. The living context of communication with the world in language, the mutual enrichment of subject and object, had now given way to a scene of devastation: the living context usurped by the deathly dregs of life (1993a, 27). Adorno's interpretive strategy will be to try to use the experiencing subject to break out of the mutilated experience within the constituting subject. In prac-tice, this will mean recovering the potential of cognitive concepts to work as a form of expression. This is what Adorno means when he talks of giving the concept a turn toward nonidentity (1966, 24)

In his critique of Husserl, Adorno will argue that epistemological inquiry as such presupposes the nar-rowing of experience that, historically, inaugurates the constituting subject.

No correction of an error of idealist epistemology would be possible without necessarily producing a new error. —Adorno, Metakritik der Erkenntnistheorie


We cannot “step outside” the frame that governs what counts as genuine knowledge, the frame of epistemological inquiry, and reach across to recapture the subjugated elements that would make cognition whole. But what the neg-ative dialectic—the “rational process of revision against rationality” (1973, 87)—will do is to drive epistemological concepts to the point where they express, through their innermost structure, the experience of diremption. In this way, epistemological concepts will disclose the experience of suffering that has become sedimented within them. Adorno's intention in his metacri-tique, then, is to coax epistemological concepts to express what is presupposed by their operation as epistemological concepts. Rather than simply subsuming experience as dismembered conceptual contents, the concept becomes a riddle the deciphering of which points to the historical world: it discloses the world in the form of spiritual experience.
