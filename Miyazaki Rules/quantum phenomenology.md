#Outlines for a phenomenological foundation for Quantum Mechanics / for de Ronde's theory of powers and potentia

In this presentation I wish to offer some basic outlines for a phenomenological foundation for de Ronde's theory of powers and potentia. In the context of the search for an alternative ontology for quantum mechanics, in the hope of finding conceptual understanding of the quantum phenomena; it is that I believe phenomenology can provide some guide and clarity. According to the basic principles of transcendental phenomenology, there must always be a noetic-noematic correlation; that is to say, a correlation between the acts consciousness performs and the objects it intends. In this line, I wish to offer the conceptual possibility of constituting an ontology based on de Ronde's principles of: Indetermination, Difference, and superposition and the concepts of power and potentia (de Ronde, 2013).
To do this, I will refer to the phenomenological concepts of thetic character, modes of intentionality and the motivations of the constitutive function, to show that in the life world we already carry out constitutions of noemata that (may) have some sort of contradictory properties (or _parts_ in the sense of Husserl's Formal Ontology), as it is in the case of the empathic constitution of the other. Even if the correspondence between this level of constitution and that which we would perform for the quantum domain are not the same, it would still be the case that: phenomenology explains the difference between both, and the constitutions of the life world could serve as proof of the possibility of, and as a guiding principle to, the constitutions that allow us access into the quantum domain.
