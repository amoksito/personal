#Petr Kouba: The Phenomenon of Mental Disorder. Perspectives of Heidegger’s Thought in Psychopathology-Springer International.

En el Zollikoner, los conceptos de ser-ahí (Dasein) y estancia (sojourn-Aufenthalt) se usan como sinónimos. 

_Aufenthalt_ es la palabra alemana para _Êthos_ y significa _estancia_, _lugar del habitar_ (_Des Wohnens_). Se trata del ámbito abierto, en el cuál el hombre habita (_wohnt_). En su historia de la metafísica, Heidegger se preocupa por los diferentes modos en que el hombre habita el mundo. Por ejemplo, en su meditar sobre la técnica, se trata de analizar el modo de habitar, el _Aufenthalt_ propio de la técnica.

# Desordenes/Transtornos Mentales

Kouba va a tomar como su objeto de descripción fenomenológica los __desordenes mentales__. También podríamos hablar de __enajenación__, como en la demencia o en la psicosis, pero esta es, probablemente, más específica. 

El problema con los __desordenes mentales__ es que parece remitir más a problemas epistémicos o cognitivos que a problemas afectivos, y, en rigor, la psicopatología se ocupa más de los últimos que de los primeros. Por supuesto, la psiquiatría toma como su campo de estudio todo el territorio de lo mental, y se ocupa tanto de desviaciones cognitivas como afectivas. Pero, aún así, "lo mental" parece referir más a lo cognitivo que a lo afectivo. Cómo sea, la psicopatología puede tratar estos desordenes como fundamentandose sobre causas naturales, o sobre otro tipo de causas. Así, la primer advertencia de Petr Kouba, con lo que queda claro cuál será el sesgo de su investigación, es en contra del método naturalista a la hora de estudiar tales desordenes mentales:

>Even while dealing with the most severe cases known to psychopathology, experts shouldn’t give in to the impression that what they observe are mere effects of natural mechanisms rather than human existence in all of its essential features. If this impression prevails, they deprive themselves of the only possible guidelines that can positively lead to an unreduced and undistorted understanding of pathological states. Doctors who do not want to ignore the individual experience of their patients must always keep in mind that “the unifying pole in psychotherapeutic science is the existing human being.”

Pero Kouba tiene bien en cuenta los repatos que pusimos antes, y por eso él mismo va a consentir en que hablar de "enfermedad mental" es, la mayoría de las veces, incorrecto. Dado que se trata siempre de una experiencia particular y, por lo mismo, de un determinado vínculo con el mundo. O mejor, se trata del vínculo entre una existencia humana (no díremos, todavía, sujeto) y el mundo en que dicha existencia humana se situa. 

>From what has been said here thus far, it already becomes clear that to talk about “mental” illness in connection with human existence is at least misleading, for the disturbances designated by this term are in their nature not only psycho-somatic, but involve complex relations to the world in which human existence is involved.

# Estados Psicopatológicos y Dasein

## Ezquisofrenia

Lo que una lectura fenomenológica de los estados psicopatológicos demanda, entonces, es explorar la relación entre el sujeto y el mundo, o, para ponerlo en terminos de Heidegger, entre _Dasein_ y _Ser-en-el-Mundo_.

También podríamos, nosotros, hablar de __conciencia__, pero siempre hay que tener cuidado de no hipostasiar a la conciencia y transformarla en una substancia, o concebirla a la manera de un objeto. Biswanger, por su parte, va a seguir la primera alternativa. 

>Binswanger is well aware of this, taking in his crucial treatise on schizophrenia the phenomenological analysis of being-in-the world as his point of departure. If, for the sake of convention, we have to resort to the expression “mental disorder” we shouldn’t forget that what is meant thereby is a specific disturbance of being-in-the-world.

Los estados mentales patológicos en los que solemos pensar son la demencia, la psicósis, y diferentes tipos de neurósis. Casi todos los clasificamos en torno a estos, ya se trate de una paranoia (como psicósis) o una histeria, neurastenia o hipocondria (neurosis de transferencia o neurosis actuales). Pero también hay otros extremadamente importantes, como la __ezquisofrenia__. 

Digamos algo sobre esta. La etimología de ezquisofrenia viene de schizein: romper, dividir, y phren: mente, razón. Así, se trata de un estado demencial si se quiere, de una mente o razón rota, dividida. Existen varios tipos de ezquisofrenia, que pueden llevar, incluso, a un __estado catatónico__. Como sea, lo importante es que entre los __transtornos mentales__ de los que Biswanger se ocupa, está la ezquisofrenia. Y, para él, está se relaciona con una determinada manera de encontrarse en el claro del ser, en la morada o vivienda del ser. Allí, el encuentro con lo desconocido es usual. Pero, mientras que para una conciencia normal, dichos encuentros son soportables; para el ezquisofrénico no es el caso. 

>As Binswanger’s analysis of various cases of schizophrenia makes clear, the disturbance of dwelling (vivienda, morada) in the clearing of beings entails the disintegration of the consistency of experience. Whereas the so-called “natural” experience can indeed also integrate encounters with the unknown and the unexpected without the slightest violation of its consistency, a schizophrenic existence is destabilized to such an extent that the integral order of its experience comes undone. The inconsistency of experience in its various forms can be observed in Binswanger’s casuistries, together with the resulting effort to re-establish the meaningful order of existence. The impossibility of a balanced being-in-the world, merely emphasized by the futility of repetitious attempts to stabilize itself, thrusts human existence into an impasse. The threat of disintegration of individual existence becomes manifest in the incessantly recurring inconsistency of experience, which can result in utter resignation. Although schizophrenia represents a certain extreme in this respect, a similar disorder of being-in-the-world announces itself (albeit to a much lesser extent) also in the case of other pathological changes of human existence. Disorders of the neurotic character, obsessive states, phobias, deep depressions – none of these leads to a disintegration of consistency of experience, and yet they all reflect a disturbance in the open relation to beings, whether to things, to others, or to one’s own body.

Para Binswanger la ezquisofrenia es solo un caso límite del estado patológico de ser-en-el-mundo. Lo que usualmente se toma por desordenes mentales, o transtornos mentales, son para él maneras patológicas de relacionarse con el mundo. En su límite, implican una desorganización, que no hay manera de darle un momento de unidad coherente al complejo de dichas relaciones. En el caso del ezquisofrenico lo que tenemos, entonces, es un encuentro totalmente perturbador con el mundo, que llevará, llegado el caso, incluso a la renuncia del intento de darle sentido a tales experiencias. 

## Cohesión de la Experiencia

Sin embargo, esto no es exclusivo de la ezquisofrenia. Otros estados patológicos más leves, como las neurosis, las fobias, las depresiones, etc; también son casos en donde hay una __perturbación__ de la manera natural de enfrentarse con la realidad. Evidentemente está "naturalización" de una supuesta "salud afectiva" del "dasein normal" es complicada y puede ponerse en cuestión. Pero asumamos, por el bien del argumento, que hay algo así como un ideal regulativo y apriorístico de salud mental del Dasein del que puede más o menos hacerse sentido, y a partir de allí tratemos de entender que quiere decir, entonces, que el vínculo con el mundo se ha visto perturbado o, peor aún, totalmente roto. 

Tengamos en cuenta que, en rigor, lo que se rompe nunca es el lazo con el mundo. Este pervive, siempre presente, inescapable, incluso para la mentalidad ezquisofrenica. Lo propio de esta es su incapacidad para hacer concordar experiencias disímiles. Cuando se llega al paroxismo de esta situación, se pierde la consistencia total de la experiencia. En casos más puntuales, son experiencias concretas las que __no se pueden digerir__, para decirlo con Patricia. Así, en estos casos más leves, hay como dos conjuntos de experiencia. Ambos remiten al mundo, pero mientras que el primero da una imagen coherente de este, el segundo no; y no hay forma de hacer concordar el primero con el segundo. 

El psicoanálisis también se concentra sobre estas experiencias inconsistentes. De hecho, para el autor el psicoanalisis es, sobre todo, una analítica de la finitud, que se ocupa de cosas como la Muerte, la Ley y el Deseo, motivos todos que siempre quedan un poco por fuera de nuestra experiencia posible. O, para decirlo en terminos fenomenológicos, no hay experiencia directa, en primera persona, en carne y hueso, de la Muerte, la Ley y el Deseo. No se trata de intuiciones, sino de constituciones que dependen de un ida y vuelta desde una intuicion, hacia una abstracción, y devuelta hacia la intuición. Pero, incluso esos intentos son, en última instancia, fallidos, dado que, como dice el autor, uno puede extenuarse en la muerte, el deseo puede vaciarse de objeto, y el lenguaje operar como una ley vacia.

>As an analytic of finitude, psychoanalysis directly addresses that which other humanities can observe only indirectly. Its focus is the realm of the empirical, out of which emerge the empty figures of Death, Desire and Law, irreducible to any given system of representation. When human being exhausts itself in the infinite repetition of death, when desire becomes devoid of its object and language operates as an empty law, modern thought encounters the finitude which is the very basis of our existing, thinking and speaking.

También otros autores, como Foucault, se han ocupado de estos temas. Foucault le presta especial atención a la ezquisofrenia, dado que esta, para él, revela la finitud humana en su forma más clara y esencial. Para él, la ezquisofrenia involucra el colapso de la intencionalidad de la experiencia, dado que no hay horizonte alguno para cada una de ellas. Todas, por separado, reclaman a la vez a un individuo que, justamente, deja de serlo en tal desmesura de la horizonticidad. Se trata, ahora, más que de un individuo, de un dividuo o dividido, enfrentandose a los múltiples reclamos o motivaciones del mundo, de manera completamente caótica.

>Since it is schizophrenia that reveals finitude in its crystal clear form, Foucault regards it as the ultimate vanishing point and simultaneously the ordeal proper to psychoanalytic inquiry. Although psychoanalysis can never by any means fathom the ground of schizophrenia, it must incessantly approach this peculiar form of experience, whose intentional structure collapses. What brings about this endless descent is not the fact that schizophrenic disturbance of existence is equivalent to a profound deficiency of the common sense. Rather, its necessity springs from the fact that schizophrenic inconsistency of experience reveals in non-sense and un-reason the bottomless depth of human facticity. Nonsense and un-reason are, strictly speaking, located outside of the sphere within which the categories of error, deceit and untruth are applicable, for what they unveil are the essential qualities of human existence: its contingency and finitude.

Aclaración: _To fathom_ something is to understand it thoroughly, and is usually used in the negative, as in "I can't fathom why he doesn't want to go along with us."

EXISTENCIA HUMANA => TEMPORALIDAD. 

Los interpretes de Husserl siempre le han prestado especial atención a sus _Lecciones sobre la Conciencia Constitutiva del Tiempo Inmanente_. La estructura triple de la temporalidad, con el punto cero del ahora, y los momentos ahora-recién-pasado y ahora-por-venir, o, en otras palabras, retención-ahora-protención, es fundamental para entender la constitución de cualquier objetividad en el tiempo. Pero la misma estructura dota de un significado específico el ser particular de la existencia humana, va a decir Heidegger. Aunque, por supuesto, en esto Heidi no está solo, también Schutz, Gurwitsch, Sartre y Merleau-Ponty ven en la temporalidad uno de los estratos más fundamentales de la existencia humana, o uno de los __existenciarios__ más necesarios de aclaración, para decirlo, nuevamente, con Heidegger. 

Ahora bien, la pregunta en este punto es: ¿Cómo se conecta la temporalidad de la existencia, tanto en sus roles cognitivos como afectivos, con los desordenes psicopatológicos?

>Insofar as the individuality of human existence is inextricably connected with its temporality, one needs to ask what role, in this respect, is played by the possibility of a psychopathological disorder. If temporality is the only medium determining human existence in its individuality, how is it possible to relate to it that form of finitude which manifests itself in the inconsistency of human experience? As Foucault mentions in his Naissance de la Clinique, the experience of individuality in modern thought is born not out of relating to the Infinite, but out of experiencing death.

La insistencia de Kouba en Foucault es un poco molesta en este punto, evidentemente no es la mejor fuente a la cual referirse para tratar estas problemáticas desde un punto de vista constitutivo-estricto. Sin embargo, y a pesar de los límites de su método genealógico, alguna luz puede llegar a arrojar, pero solo desde la perspectiva de lo que toma prestado... Como sea, Kouba va a utilizar las reflexiones de Foucault en torno al cambio de perspectiva, en la modernidad, respecto al telos final de la experiencia humana: si antes era el Infinito de Dios, o en-Dios; ahora pasa a ser la experiencia de la propia finitud a través de una nueva conciencia de la muerte como fin-de-la-existencia. De allí, también, el nuevo interes por la medicina, en todas sus formas. 

La experiencia de la muerte en este sentido es fundamental para Foucault porque abre las puertas para la constitución de la subjetividad del sujeto moderno, esto es, como __invididualidad__, __singularidad__. La muerte, prosigue interpretando Kouba, es esfera privilegiada de la medicina, en un mundo cada vez más secularizado, y pasa de ser uno de los ámbitos privilegiados del discurso religioso, a convertirse en el paradigma último de las investigaciones de la medicina. Recuerdese, sin ir más lejos, como un Descartes, por ejemplo, con su comprehensión mecánica del funcionamiento del cuerpo humano pretendía alcanzar el saber necesario para volver a tal maquina una maquina-imperedecera, es decir, una biología inmortal. Una visión todavía impregnada de ingenuidad medieval, si se quiere, dado que prontamente incluso el positivismo iluminista va a aceptar el caracter inevitable de la muerte.

Como sea, la psiquiatría, como parte de la medicina, se inserta en el ámbito de los discursos y del saber bajo esta perspectiva.

>The relation to death cuts human being off from universality and bestows upon its existence a singular character. By virtue of its intimate experience with death, medicine obtains a privileged position among the other sciences about man, for it especially makes contact with the ontological status of human existence as such. In this respect psychiatry is no different from the rest of medical knowledge. Death which seizes human being in the disintegration of consistency of experience is by no means a mere event to be discerned among others, but it is first and foremost the foundational vanishing point of human existence. For schizophrenia or any other psychopathological disorder to develop, death must be there, already anonymously at work in the very heart of human existence. Accordingly, individual existence asserts itself in its resistance to this form of human finitude.

## Zollikoner

En el Seminario Zollikoner se estudia la esencia de los desordenes psicopatológicos, concibiendoselos sobre la base de la __unidad integral__ de la existencia individual. No nos referimos, acá, a la necesidad de pensar el momento de unidad de la vida intencional, sino más bien al conjunto de los contenidos y las relaciones que hacen a una vida humana dada. Un desorden psicopatológico no es tanto, entonces, un desorden quimico o neurológico, como una ruptura de las relaciones del invididuo con su medio, que puede, entonces, manifestarse por medio de aberraciones corporales como las estudiadas tipicamente por la psiquiatría. Se trata, entonces, de reacciones de la vida. Es la vida, la existencia misma, la que causa, si se quiere, los desordenes químicos, y no los desordenes químicos los que provocan las dificultades "existenciales" en los individuos.

>Zollikoner Seminare as well, where the essence of psychopathological disorders is determined on the basis of the integral unity of individual existence. The schizophrenic’s alleged experience of being dead, the collapse of the world, and the disintegration of the self thus appear merely as expressions of a deficient dwelling in the clearing of beings and not as original, non-derived phenomena.

Otros autores, también en la orbita de Foucault, que van a ser traídos a colación por Kouba son Deleuze y Gauttari, con su llamado __ezquisoanálisis__, desarrollado en su conocido libro _Capitalismo y Esquisofrenia_, donde también desarrollan el concepto de __rizoma__, en un intento de dar cuenta de las múltiplicidades, en una suerte de alternativa a la __ontología formal__. 

Importante acá: DES-PERSONALIZACIÓN, explorar los procesos a-personales en los que está necesariamente ha de basarse.

>In order not to set out in blindness to the border zone of the modern episteme, guidelines must be found which could serve us as a critical correlate of the results of Heidegger’s inquiry. Apart from Foucault’s archeology of knowledge, such guidelines should be sought mainly in the so-called schizoanalysis, created by the shared effort of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in opposition to the mainstream of modern psychiatry and its individualistic conception of psychopathological disorders. As the word itself suggests, the task of schizoanalysis is to comprehend schizophrenia as a crucial philosophical problem that casts light not only on the boundaries of the individual existence, but also on the limits of human existence as such. Insofar as Deleuze and Guattari object to Binswanger’s approach to schizophrenia (and implicitly to the phenomenological project of the temporal dwelling in the clearing of beings) due to its methodical adherence to human individuality whose presupposition a priori precludes an adequate explication of clinical states of deep depersonalization or delirious states and the related hallucinations, their schizoanalysis is conducted with the intention of penetrating to the a-personal processes that repeatedly confirm the disintegration of individual existence.

# Errores metodológicos. Ciencia Inhumana. 

(Methodological Pitfalls 2.1 Inhuman Science). 


En el Zollikoner Heidegger critíca a las ciencias naturales y su dominio en el area de la psiquiatría. El autor quiere comparar estas críticas con el __analísis epistemológico__ de Foucault en _Las palabras y las cosas_ y _El nacimiento de la clínica_. El problema va a pasar a ser, entonces, dice Kouba, la _mathesis universalis_ que sirve como una matrix general para el pensamiento científico, y no reserva ningún lugar para la existencia humana. Para poder captar en su concretitud la existencia humana, tanto la fenomenología como la medicina tienen que alejarse del esquema conceptual de la _mathesis universalis_ y de la noción clásica de pensamiento. Así, y junto con la individualidad de la existencia humana, se descubre el fenómeno del cuerpo vivido, lo cual refleja la naturaleza psicosomática de la existencia humana. Heidegger hace esto en el Zollikoner, al integrar la existencia humana con el fenómeno del cuerpo vivido en la compleja estructura del ser-en-el-mundo. 

Pero empecemos con el primer momento de crítica. Lo que está en juego no es la efectividad de la medicina o de los tratamiento médicos, la enorme cantidad de información sobre los procesos en los organismos humanos, etc; sino el _approach_, la manera de acercarse a la propia existencia humana lo que es problemático. El punto es: ¿Qué es real para la ciencia natural? 

> From the purely instrumental conception of method Heidegger distinguishes method in the more original sense of the word, substantially different from the methodology of scientific inquiry. As the sense of the Greek words μετά and όδός (the “way from here to there” or the “way toward”) suggests, method in the original etymological sense denotes an approach by means of which the character of the examined area is revealed and delineated. For the scientific theses and experiments to come into play at all, it is first and foremost necessary to gain access to the area under scrutiny. Only within the framework of an area open and determined by means of a certain method is it possible to invoke incontestable facts, while elaborating on theses and verifying experimentally their validity.

Para que pueda haber un tratamiento matemático de algo, ha de suponerse, en primer lugar, que el area de investigación del que se trate es __mensurable__. Y aún más, __matemáticamente mensurable__. 

Ahora bien, la __mensurabilidad de los seres__, presupuesta por las ciencias exáctas, involucra una comprensión de los mismos en terminos de caracteres puramente cuantitativos: la física debe descartar cualquier riqueza cualitativa de la vida y focalizarse exclusivamente en sus factores capaces de ser aprehendidos matemáticamente. Las entidades naturales, a las cuales se les ha arrancado su __potencial semántico__, permanencen simplemente como la suma de _data_ cuantitativamente grabable y mutuamente comparable. El aparato matemático logra algo más: la mensuralibidad de los seres muta como comptabilidad o calculabilidad. 

> What lies in their measurability is also the preliminary calculability of all processes under observation. That is to say, the changes taking place are pre-adumbrated so that different eventualities of their course are predictable.

Ahora bien, ¿qué más está supuesto allí? La mensurabilidad de la naturaleza lleva a su __computabilidad__. Pero, ¿qué más hace falta para que la naturaleza sea computable, además de ser mensurable? Heidegger dice: una cierta __regularidad en la naturaleza__. Esto supone a su vez __idealizaciones__ que constituyan un tiempo y un espacio homogeneos. Y también la __causalidad__.

>Besides, Heidegger’s exposition of the methodological principles of mathematical natural science shows that the prediction of changes is possible only under conditions that guarantee elementary regularity in nature. In order for such conditions to be met, there must take place idealization, which yields homogeneous space and homogeneous time. Without it the modern conception of physical science as realized by Galileo and Newton could never have been formulated. Galileo’s principal point of departure that posits the conditions of empirical inquiry is the supposition in which the occurrence of change is regarded as a regular change of the position of mass-points in homogeneous space and time. What is postulated in this supposition is also causality without which exact predictability would remain inconceivable. The scientific rationalism proper to physics is based on the belief that every occurrence must be the effect of some cause.

Supuestos: 

1. Mensurabilidad de la Naturleza
2. Computabilidad
3. Regularidad de la Naturaleza
4. Tiempo y Espacio Homogeneos
5. Idealizaciones 
6. Causalidad

Esta concepción de los seres, dice Heidegger, es plenamente moderna. Ni en la Antiguedad ni durante la Edad Media encontramos algo así. 

> whereas ancient culture comprehended natural phenomena in the sense of the Greek φαίνεσθαι, i.e. as something manifested by means of disclosing itself out of concealment, medieval thought viewed all beings as created by the God.

El _Aufenthalt_ del hombre en el Mundo es en cada caso diferente. Llegamos, entonces, a la concepción moderna de la Naturaleza, que es el _Aufenthalt_ general del hombre en está época. Ahora, se trata de los seres como de __objetividades__. Y esto solo ocurre cuando las cosas no están presentes por sí mismas, sino que se las concibe como solo pudiendo aparecer a través de las ideas de un sujeto pensante. 

- Seres = Re-presentaciones. 

> In comparison with these views of reality, objectiveness means a certain modification of the presence of beings. Natural science is made possible by a change due to which natural beings are no longer conceptualized as present in themselves; their presence can be manifested only by virtue of the ideas of the thinking subject. Although the reality of nature is not quite denied or condemned to the sphere of mere seeming or “semblance”, the presence of natural beings is thus comprehended as re-presentation. What in effect is at stake here is the radical reversal in the understanding of being of natural beings – their being is inextricably linked to their representation in the subjective mind.

Este tipo de meditaciones acerca de los fundamentos de la física matemática también podemos encontrarlos en sus lecturas de 1935/36 publicadas bajo el título de _Die Frage nach dem Ding_, donde Heidegger intenta explicar el caracter del orden matemático que subyace a las concepciones de Galileo y Newton de la Naturaleza.

> For nature to be intelligible by means of mathematics, it needs to be axiomatically determined as equally distributed spatiotemporal nexus of mass-points; therefore, what can be projected into the scientific picture are only bodies integrated into this nexus.

Esto es también, lo que permite la concepción arquitectónica del conocimiento: 

> What is at stake is not mathematics itself, but rather a project of the factual essence of beings that allows for a neat classification and gradual transition from the elementary toward the most complex of knowledge. The mathematical order as the principal standpoint of mathematical natural science creates the grounding that allows for the division of unclear and complex sentences into simple theses and, by drawing upon these in a rationally intelligible sequence, results in an understanding of the complex ones. In the overall arrangement and composition of everything within the order of mathesis universalis lies the broadest foundation on which mathematical physics is built.


This matrix, claims Heidegger, is not only the origin of mathematical natural science and modern mathematics (Leibnitz’s discovery of differential calculus, etc.), but also Cartesian philosophy as such. Descartes’ philosophical system is arguably the fruit of deep reflections upon the mathematical order; as if the mathematical tendency in thinking had awoken and grasped itself by considering itself the criterion of all thought and devising the rules it brings forth. It is only on the basis of the mathematical order that the need arises for the discovery of the first, altogether indubitable thesis that could serve as the ultimate axiom for all other sentences, irrespective of what they address. The statement “I think therefore I am” can be the absolute foundation for the certainty of cognition only because it relies on mathesis universalis as the basic matrix of the seventeenth century thought. The objectification of all beings present-at-hand would be meaningless without it, for these are put in relation to the subject of the axiom “I think – I am”.


It is interesting to note here that the characteristics of mathematically organized knowledge mentioned above converges in many respects with Foucault’s picture of the classical episteme. As the epistemological investigation undertaken in Les mots et les choses indicates, the arrival of classical science in the seventeenth century marks a rupture in the history of European thought. Not that science would have only at this point acquired a sense of measure and order; what occurred was that an altogether extraordinary importance was attributed to the values which had to some extent already been acknowledged. What is characteristic of the epistemological field of classical science is that measure and order serve as points of departure as well as the ultimate imperatives of thought.


Descartes’ Regulae


Apart from comparing quantities for the sake of determining the arithmetical relations of equality and inequality among things, Descartes also acknowledges comparison by means of order, within whose framework the simplest term is found and from there also the progression from simpler to more complex elements. As the measurement of size or amount can be reduced to creating order (since arithmetic and physical quantities may be arranged into a continuous row), both of the types merely represent two different ways of determining the progression from the simple to the complex. Thus, Foucault concludes that it is the idea of mathesis universalis, of the overall, rationally observable order, that plays the key role in the classical episteme. No matter how prevalent mathematical formalism might be within certain scientific realms, the plane proper to classical knowledge is not the mathematization of all reality and the concomitant conversion of a qualitative difference into a quantitative one. The mathematization of the empirical asserts itself only in such realms of classical science as the Galilean and Newtonian physics, whereas the relation of understanding to the general order as proposed in mathesis universalis also concerns the non-quantifiable. Insofar as classical science as a whole shares some common characteristics, this lies, according to Foucault, in its preoccupation with what he terms “the calculable order” in the broadest sense of the word. The reference to Regulae also lays bare another consequence of general calculability: the possibility of an exhaustive inventory. Whether the issue under consideration is an exhaustive list of all elements of a given set, or a division of an observed field into specific categories, or an analysis of a sufficiently representative specimen, mathesis universalis always guarantees the possibility of an exhaustive inventory as well as a continual transition from basic levels of understanding to the most complex ones.


To remain within the field of natural scientific investigation: a good example of a science formed on the basis of classical episteme is so-called “natural history.” According to Foucault, this science that deals with the order in the realm of living beings relies on the idea of a universal calculus, without necessarily resorting to mathematical reductionism.


Even the utilization of such an extraordinary means as the microscope is no exception to this rule. The exposition offered in Les mots et les choses proves the contrary: the implementation of the microscope is conditioned by a systematic reduction of the scientific perspective. Smells, tastes, and tactile sensations – all become excluded from the scientific observation. On the other hand, what is overtly privileged is sight, the sense of clarity and extension. Nevertheless, even sight is not accepted without certain limitation: especially the perception of colors is suppressed to the very minimum and what stands in the forefront are lines, areas, forms and surfaces. To observe is thus to determine natural beings with regard to their form, number, size and mode of their placement in space. However, this space is not the natural ambience of living beings, but an abstract space out of which all vital relations have been excluded. Whether concrete pieces of knowledge are ascertained quantitatively, or by means of geometrical forms, or through exact description, it is always within a visual field reduced to pure extension. The theme proper to natural history is therefore extension in which natural beings are manifested. In this respect, natural history is not by any means remote from mathematical physics that finds a guarantee for the quantifiability of natural beings in their position within the realm of res extensa.


The key to a reliable recognition of a certain animal or plant is their characteristic trait. Natural history focuses on determining the characteristic traits, thanks to which it states the differences among natural beings and classifies them, dividing them up into genera and species so that every creature finds its own place in the natural scheme of things.


As every category must stand in relation to all others, what is peculiar to a certain specimen cannot be recognized except on the basis of a classification of natural beings. An animal or a plant has no identity of its own; it is that which others are not, as it is discernible only by means of differentiation. To identify a certain specimen is thus to ascertain what it is that sets it apart from other species. Any identification of natural beings encompasses a whole chain of differentiations.


It persistently analyzes the relations of their affinity solely by means of the notions of identity and difference


Therefore, Foucault can indeed proclaim the classical episteme as a whole to be characterized not only by the universal science of order, but also by the search for identity and difference.


Naissance de la clinique, where Foucault addresses the so-called classificatory medicine. Similarly to natural history, classificatory medicine cannot do without a taxonomical system, within whose framework diseases are classified and hierarchized into various genera and species. What is important for its concerns is not so much the mechanical functioning of the corporeal apparatus or exact measurement of its blood pressure and temperature as the precise diagnosis of the type of disease and its ranking within the classifying system of diseases.


In the light of these observations, Heidegger’s evaluation of the natural scientific mode of reasoning that is presented in Zollikon Seminars requires a certain adjustment. It is not problems of mathematical physics, but rather the foundational character of the mathematical project of beings as such that is to receive attention. In relation to the primary mathematical project, physics remains only one of the realms in which mathesis universalis has shaped itself as the cardinal standpoint to beings in general. Heidegger himself is very clearly aware of it in his Die Frage nach dem Ding where he stresses that the question of whether the utilization of mathematical procedures is indeed justified with regard to immediately present nature is not so important as the decision concerning the verification and limits of the mathematical order as such. It is not enough to confront the will to render nature quantifiable on the one hand, and nature essentially recalcitrant to it on the other. Behind the dilemma between mathematical formalism and the clarifying view of natural beings looms the question of limits beyond which the idea of mathesis universalis loses its justification.


In Zollikoner Seminare, the special position and function of scientific concepts receives careful scrutiny.


6Scientific thought, derived from the mathematical project of beings, requires in the first place that the concepts should be thoroughly unambiguous. Any ambiguity is to be excluded by means of a clear definition of every single notion. A correct definition proceeds in such a way that characterizes an entity by means of primary generality and secondary specificity; a general definition of an entity is accompanied by a characteristic trait that differentiates a given entity from other entities of the same kind. Definition thus proceeds from a higher category to the delineation of a specific difference. By virtue of this procedure, it is possible to single out and delimit one entity as opposed to all others.


So far, a conceptual definition wouldn’t be different from the way in which the Ancient thought used to differentiate various categories of beings. What is important, however, is to realize that conceptual thought as constituted on the basis of mathesis universalis is inextricably linked with representation. Heidegger claims a concept to be a re-presentation of something. The very word “concept” ( der Begriff) inherently echoes “capture” or “concentration” which becomes, on the basis of the mathematical project, a representation of something. However, what is represented within the framework of conceptual representation is not a singular entity, but that which is common to all beings of a certain type. This representation is what remains identical in all individual cases. Only with regard to identity that is contained within every scientific concept is it possible to comprehend individual beings as representatives of relevant species. Although a concept is a representation of what is identically the same, it is still impossible to speak of this identity in positive terms. The identity represented in a concept has a sense only in relation to differences arranged within the overall system of understanding. Thus, the structure of mathesis universalis within the framework of conceptual thought is manifested as a complex order of identities and differences.


Any singularity gets lost by necessity in the interminable interplay of identities and differences.


It is this problem that Foucault alludes to while considering in his Naissance de la clinique the ambivalent attitude that classificatory medicine takes toward human suffering: as long as the view of medical science aims to penetrate through the plethora of pathological symptoms to their invariable foundation, it must suppress the uniqueness of every individual case and highlight what is common to all cases of the same kind. In order to pinpoint the basis of pathological disorder correctly, classificatory medicine must keep its distance from the individual experience of the patient and bracket all unclassifiable factors such as innate dispositions, temperament, or age. A qualified medical treatment cannot do without a perfected command of the classifying system of diseases that serves as a preliminary guideline of cognition, whereas the patient’s individuality is merely a negative attribute of the illness. Rather than the personal uniqueness of the patient and the unmistakable nature of his individuality, what is really important is the precise identification of the disease and its differentiation from all other elements of the nosological system. The individual side of human ordeal, including the peculiar multivocal nature of the space in which the doctor meets the patient, is thus bound to stay in the background of theoretical interest. Although classificatory medicine does not remain altogether blind to these phenomena, this is not due to its methodical effort to identify and differentiate the various kinds of pathology, but rather in spite of this.


One might object that Cartesian philosophy at least maintains a relation to individual experience that is echoed in the foundational tenet of “I think.” However, as Heidegger observes in Die Frage nach dem Ding, the “I” as based on the mathematical order and promoted to the paramount status of the thinking subject contains nothing particular or unique.


The ego is what is always already present prior to any representation. Thus, the basis of the Cartesian “I” is not the individuality of a specific human being, but the permanent presence of the thinking subject. The “I” means nothing more and nothing less than res cogitans, out of which all qualities except for the ability to think have been abstracted.


Heidegger does not miss a single opportunity to point to the fact that an ontology that understands being from the viewpoint of representation does not do justice to human existence. In his opinion, the peculiar character of human existence cannot be understood as long as human being is rendered an object about which scientific thought obtains data by means of conceptual representations. The inadequacy of this approach is demonstrated by the fact that human experiences and moods are not objects within the sphere of res extensa, something which was already known to Descartes. It is insufficient to proclaim human existence to have, in addition to its somatic part, also a part pertaining to the realm of res cogitans, and go on to examine their mutual effects. The multivocal shades and minute nuances of mental life cannot be understood once converted into representations in the consciousness of an abstractly conceived subject. The same applies to the human body which can be imagined as a physical mechanism and whose components can be subjected to physiological inquiry, but only at the cost of losing all human uniqueness. What then remains of it is an object torn out of its relation to its environment, an object resisting inner development and changes that have to do with aging. At best, ageing can manifest itself as dilapidation or imperfection that science may manage to remedy one day, but not as a natural principle of life.


Nevertheless, the mere fact that classical science has its historical beginning implies that one day it is bound to reach its end. The idea of universal calculability as born in the seventeenth century does not necessarily have to perish together with it, but it most definitely must be deprived of its claim to absolute validity. In that very moment, the question of the limits of the universal science of measure and order becomes topical. It would therefore be inane to regard Heidegger’s critical reference to the inadequacy of all attempts at thematisation of human existence by means of a method that is grounded upon preliminary objectification and conceptual identification of observed beings as an expression of ill-concealed enmity to science as such. Heidegger himself refuses such a suspicion when claiming: “By no means should our discussions be understood as hostile toward science. In no way is science as such rejected.”


A real, and not merely illusory, approach to human being requires a philosophical method that would be fully appropriate to the specifically human way of existence. The demanded method must strictly adhere to the mode in which human existence shows itself, and leave it at that. A method that meets the given criterion and allows for the thematization of human existence without inadmissible distortion or confusion is found in phenomenological description. According to Heidegger, phenomenology provides us with the optimal approach to human existence whose reach qualitatively surpasses the mode of thematization based on mathesis universalis.


First of all, phenomenology is not a procedure for acquiring pieces of scientific knowledge, but a method in the original sense of the word, i.e. a way that opens a certain realm of beings. Moreover, human being from the phenomenological point of view does not manifest itself as a specimen of a certain species, be it a categorical determination of an entity traditionally defined as animal rationale. Unlike science shaped within the horizon of representational thought that reduces all phenomena to objects of conceptual comprehension, phenomenology strictly forbids such reductionism.


Phenomenological description does not lie in the representation of facts stated in the sphere of res extensa; its orientation is rather subjected to manifesting every phenomenon in terms of what is peculiar to it. Since they are not representations woven into any well established network of identities and differences, and their sense is drawn directly from what they speak of, phenomenological notions can reveal both the uniqueness and the ambiguity of concrete phenomena. 10 Although phenomenology is not devoid of the character of conceptual thought, its notions are not so much based on the uniform matrix of mathesis universalis as they are on the uniqueness and ambiguity of what manifests itself.


The being of beings can be manifest only through thought that relates to it with understanding. Even though the being of beings does not show itself as such in the beginning, the preliminary evidence of its sense is a prerequisite for any ontic register. Compared to ontic phenomena, ontological phenomena therefore occupy the foundational position and are of primary philosophical importance. Since being as such often remains concealed behind beings that freely offer themselves to our attention, the task of phenomenology as Heidegger conceives of it is to bring being to its explicit manifestation.


The phenomenological effort to thematize the being of beings does not at all mean that beings are to be completely ignored. Heidegger is rather concerned with our relation to beings so that the being of these beings emerges thematically. This hermeneutic engagement in the relation with immediately manifest beings aims to overcome the obfuscation of ontological phenomena that remain hidden under a layer of philosophical tradition or merely filtered through it in the form of phenomenologically unclarified seeming. The need for penetrating to what remains unthought-of within the philosophical tradition necessarily leads to a revision of this tradition, and especially to a critical evaluation of the conceptual structures grounded upon the principle of mathesis universalis.


Heidegger’s critique of ideas derived from the mathematical project of beings asserts itself most conspicuously in the destruction of Descartes’ philosophical system. Against the unwavering certainty of cogito – sum that places being next to representation, Zollikoner Seminare focuses its scrutiny on the character of that sum. As Foucault in his Les mots et le choses claims that phenomenology is not so much a continuation of the tradition of Ancient thought as an expression of the rupture between the classical and modern episteme, the same applies to its Heideggerian version.


Despite the proclaimed return to the Greek conception of phenomenon as that which shows itself from itself, what is corroborated here is the original connection of phenomenology with the question of the human way of being, and together with it occurs also a certain consummation of the analytics of the finitude of this being. Instead of the objective observation of a human being or a retreat to a predetermined, closed-off subject, the phenomenological approach to human existence entails a hermeneutical entry into an open relation with what encounters and addresses us. The starting point of the phenomenological approach to human existence is thus our unmediated sojourn ( der Aufenthalt) with beings. The exceptional character of man’s sojourn ( der Aufenthalt des Menschen) is not given by occurring at some place, but rather follows from an openness toward the world that is peculiar to human existence.


A verbatim translation of the German “sich aufhalten” (where “auf” refers to a certain openness, whereas “sich halten” means “to hold on to”) suggests that the ontological character of sojourning lies in its maintaining an open horizon of the world, within whose framework significative and motivational connections present themselves in the shape of concrete beings. In the context of a disclosed and cleared sphere of the world, the sojourn always relates to that by which it is encountered and summoned to act. The sojourn finds itself always already in the world and only as being-in-the- world can it relate with understanding to specific beings as to its own possibilities.


Since we relate to our possibilities not only spiritually, but unveil them mostly by its practical action, the question of the bodily character of human existence cannot be avoided. Should the human body be regarded as an entity occurring in a certain place in space, or is it to be comprehended from the viewpoint of the ontological structure of being-in-the-world? Heidegger resolutely opts for the second option when distinguishing the lived body ( der Leib) from the corporeal thing ( der Körper). The lived body is not a mere material given, but a factual expression of being-in-the- world. The facticity of our existence remains both in its openness to the world and in its bodiliness ( die Leiblichkeit). The lived body is a natural center of gravity in our relating to possibilities around which the differences between near and far, up and down, right and left are organized. Corporeal things, on the contrary, have no relation to space at all, they merely occur in it.


The phenomenological description of the lived body can therefore not simply postulate it and go on to derive from this various directions and trajectories, but rather must persistently stick to the open spatiality of being-in-the-world. A dynamic transitional nature of the bodily existence can assert itself only on the basis of openness that characterises being-in-the-world. The peculiar character of this transitivity can be best illustrated by the fact that the boundaries of the lived body don’t align themselves with the boundaries of the body in the sense of a mere corporeal thing. Whereas our corporeal frame ends with our skin, the lived body transcends this limit.


However, one can speak of a transcendence only in the phenomenal sense, since it reflects our ecstatic relatedness to surrounding beings. As hearing, speaking and seeing constitute an essential part of our lived body, its only limit is the horizon of our world. Unlike our corporeal frame whose content can change only by growing, gaining or losing weight, the horizon of our world is freely transmutable, and thus capable of vastly surpassing all tactile sensations, as well as receding in reverse into a single intensive feeling of physical pain. What then remains after our death is only Körper, whereas our lived body ends together with our existence.


Pain, blushing with shame or weeping, all elude the view adjusted to facts represented within the realm of res extensa, and yet they remain inherent to the basic possibilities of our bodily existence. In order to find adequate access to these possibilities, it is not enough to consider them as traces of human psyche; it is rather necessary to understand them as various modes of being-in-the-world. After all, a sudden blush is not an expression of psychic processes, as it makes sense only in relation to some specific situation in the world. The same applies to all physical postures and gestures. All ontic phenomena that express our bodily existence have thus neither a psychic, nor a somatic, but a psychosomatic character. To split human existence into its psychic and somatic parts is for Heidegger to completely fail to regard their original whole as formed by being-in-the-world.


endowed


I am my own body. It would be utterly absurd to contend that the eye sees, the mouth speaks, the hand works and the brain thinks, since it is always I myself who sees, speaks, works and thinks.


Equally erroneous would be the assumption that the lived body presents a sort of substratum upon whose basis human individuality is sustained. This is evident from Heidegger’s statement: “If the body as body is always my body, then this is my own way of being. Thus, bodying forth is co-determined by my being human in the sense of the ecstatic sojourn amidst the beings in the clearing [ gelichtet].”


Since individual existence does not remain detached from change, but actively engages in it, the difference between such existence and the Cartesian subject most conspicuously manifests itself on the temporal plane. The Cartesian “I” is posited as what is always already present-at-hand; that is to say, it is a substance that cannot be affected by time. The existential constancy of the self is, on the contrary, essentially connected with time. As Heidegger puts it, “[t]he constancy of the self is temporal in itself, that is, it temporalizes itself. This selfhood of [being-there] is only in the manner of temporalizing [ Zeitigung].”


The ecstatic relatedness to beings that binds the future, the having-been and the present into one whole, ensures the essential coherence of existence, thereby endowing it with its individual constancy.


Much as this individual constancy remains open to change and existential rupture, it is also an expression of the fact that human existence always somehow understands its being, that it comprehends it as its own and, to some extent, as always the same.


16The expressions Aufenthalt and Dasein (or Da-sein ) are used by Heidegger basically as synonyms, and therefore we can use their English equivalents in the same way.


The phenomenological description of the temporal unity of existence thus arrives at the idea of sameness which is irreconcilable with the epistemological character of classical rationality. Sameness, which encompasses in itself both constancy and change, which steps out of itself and becomes other, is according to Foucault’s testimony one of the crucial components of modern episteme.


However, one must not forget that phenomenology is not the only mode of thought that on its quest for what is not identical with itself gains an understanding of individual life in its changes and duration. The revelation of human individuality is not a prerogative of only philosophical inquiry, but occurs in the much broader context of European thought, which has had its repercussions also within the field of clinical medicine, as it is documented in Naissance de la clinique. Ever since the eighteenth century, that is to say, with the arrival of modern episteme, medical thought has become increasingly appreciative of the importance of all unclassifiable factors that had thus far been supplanted by the classifying system of diseases. Individual dispositions, age or way of life have moved into the focal point of medical attention and, together with them, the specific human individual sees the light of day. Thanks to the reversal in the relation between the classifiable and the unclassifiable, the human individual becomes visible in its own singularity. Thus, according to Foucault, medicine is transformed into a science dealing with the ill and healthy individual. In spite of the fact that within the nosological system, the model of natural scientific classification is still utilized, there nonetheless occurs a shift that enables clinical medicine to penetrate into the inside of the human organism and reveal the dark depth of bodily existence. Only when pathological anatomy assumes the pivotal position within medical knowledge can medicine arrive at an understanding of a living organism, its development, aging and death. Rather than a classificatory table of diseases, what should henceforth be the focal point of medical interest is to be found in the various ways in which an ill organism resists or succumbs to pathological decomposition.


Classical medicine of natural species is thereby changed into the medicine of pathological reactions.


The phenomenon of the lived body that obtains its sense against the backdrop of the overall structure of being-in-the-world is substantially different from the anatomical constitution of the human organism or the structure of the organic tissues. Even though modern medicine has marked a breakthrough in the understanding of inner development of organic structures, the lived body still remains inaccessible to it. The lived body, which forms an integral component of the ontological whole of being-in-the-world, is the key to the understanding of many psychosomatic disorders about which clinical medicine is still in the dark. Thus, the articulation of being-in-the-world can be regarded as the most important result of the phenomenological method for medicine.


2.2 All-Too-Human Science The focus of this chapter is Binswanger’s psychiatric Daseinsanalysis, which represents the first attempt at the application of Heidegger’s philosophy in psychiatry.


in Zollikoner Seminare. Heidegger reproaches Binswanger for his anthropologism and for the complete misunderstanding of the ontological analysis of human existence.


While Binswanger understands human existence only as sojourn with beings, it is necessary to grasp it as sojourn in the openness of being. Sojourn is not only sojourn among beings, but – above all – sojourn in the openness of being. Only in this way can the individual character of our existence be understood properly. However, the question remains how to grasp the nature of mental disorders including the disintegration of the self that occurs in the most serious cases. This issue becomes even more crucial if we realize the limits of the ontological analysis of human existence that are highlighted by its confrontation with Foucalts’ notion of Unreason and by Deleuze’s critique of Heidegger formulated in Différence et répétition.


Even though no explicit mention of psychopathological phenomena is to be found in Sein und Zeit, Binswanger came to realize that the ontological analysis of being-there is of eminent importance for the realm of psychiatry. Psychiatry had already in his time achieved the understanding of mental disorders as having a reality and making sense only when treated as an inner disorder of the personality; however, it still lacked the means for thematizing the pathological aspects of the interaction between the human individual and his/her environment. In the given state of affairs, with medicine strictly distinguishing mental pathology from organic pathology, the overall position of the specific individual in the world, as well as his/ her psychosomatic unity, remained an unsolved problem.


The reflections summed up in the collection of several casuistries, published under the title Schizophrenia, depart from the discovery that the primary encounter with insanity is an encounter not with mental illness but with otherness. 19 The lay view governed by the standard rules of social behavior regards certain comportment as crazed or deranged when inappropriate to the given situation. When, for example, Binswanger’s patient Ilsa puts her hand inside a red-hot oven in order to show her father how far true love can go, her gesture is far-fetched to the point that none of her relatives can imagine themselves acting as she does. Others view her act not as a loving sacrifice but rather as senseless self-violence, which prevents them from identifying with it even hypothetically. The anxious fear of gaining weight felt by Ellen West, or the panic dread of being pursued sensed by Suzanne Urban – both seem equally foreign to “sane” reason. All of these patients of Binswanger’s move away from their fellowmen in the same degree to which they alienate themselves from the stimuli and possibilities that spring from the framework of the everyday world of practical intentions and tasks. Thus, the inevitable lot of any individual whose action is not governed by the unwritten rules and requirements of everyday reality is to rupture the bonds that connect him/her to others.


Although behavior that defies the commonly shared semantic contexts is assumed to be deranged in a given situation, it could nevertheless seem perfectly normal in a different social situation or cultural context.


What is accepted as a common or even desired way of behavior in one cultural environment is considered unacceptable in another. Whereas in the secular society, messianic visions, conversations with angels or deep dejection arising from the awareness of one’s sinfulness are regarded as expressions of religious derangement, in a religious community these can be assigned the highest value.


In the so-called primitive cultures, however, an individual can become a shaman only on the basis of his/her ability to confront others with something “beyond” their comprehension.


Irrespective of the system of social and cultural norms, insanity always first manifests itself in the form of a behavior devoid of sense.


Just as the layman, the psychiatrist sets out from the original strangeness of this conduct ( die Fremdheit dieser Handlung).


Unlike the lay public, the psychiatrist must not content himself with a mere statement of the nonsensicality of a certain behavior but must seek to understand it. His task is to penetrate into the welter of unclear motives and obscure intentions, trying to find his way around it and to discover the hidden sense of the pathological experience.


It is by no means fortuitous that Foucault notes in his Naissance de la clinique that the tendency to conceive of a disease as a specific entity which can be integrated into a classifying system on the basis of its qualities does not come to an end even with the arrival of the nineteenth century.


Psychiatry is also very slow to shake off the conviction that, thanks to the nosological system that makes it possible to divide illnesses just as natural entities into specific groups and subgroups, the culturally conditioned criteria of normality and abnormality can be surpassed and supplanted with relatively unequivocal benchmarks. If the psychiatrist should positively state the diagnosis, i.e. precisely discern the type of illness in each case, he/she needs a Bezugssystem different from that of the cultural norms, which he finds in the classifying system of the natural scientific sort. With the help of such a system, one can proceed from the original strangeness of the pathological behavior to the specific nosological unit with the same certainty with which the botanist regards a plant as belonging to the correct genus and species.


Insofar as the medical gaze regards mental illness as a functional defect, it also implies that this dysfunction must be rooted in something that surpasses all observable symptoms, determining their pathological character. Pathological symptoms, such as stereotypical behavior, anxiety or hallucinations, are thus grasped as signs pointing to some hidden essence. To determine the right diagnosis is therefore simply to judge the symptoms correctly and to decide the type, nature and anticipated course of the given illness. However, such explicated symptoms have nothing to do with the phenomenon as understood by phenomenology. The incompatibility of the phenomenon and the pathological symptom is also noted by Heidegger, claiming in his Sein und Zeit that the phenomenon is what shows itself as such, whereas symptoms of a certain illness merely indicate that which lies concealed behind them.


Insofar as insanity is to manifest itself as a phenomenon, nonsensical behavior must not be regarded as a pathological symptom, but must be brought to light out of itself. Encountering the phenomenon of insanity requires that the empirical evidence of un-reason should not be evaded, but rather approached with the hope that it will show its meaning some day. More precisely, what is at stake is to explicate the phenomenon of un- reason, while thematically exposing that which, preliminarily and concurrently, remains evident only non-thematically.


An integrated constitution of being-there functions as a unifying principle on whose basis all the seemingly disparate elements can be connected into a single whole, their meaning restored, and what eludes common understanding comprehended. Taking the structural order of being-there ( die Gefügeordnung des Daseins) as his point of departure, Binswanger is able to thematize specific traits that characterize the pathologically altered being-in-the-world as various modes of disturbance in this overall composition.


By virtue of paying heed to the ontological constitution of being-there, ontic features characteristic of an ill individual’s being open themselves to his gaze as various forms of disarrangement and ruptures of the structural moments of sojourning amidst beings. However, this breach entails no disintegration into singular, mutually heterogeneous elements, but rather a change in the way the structural moments of sojourning combine, forming a united whole. Therefore, the original sense of psychopathological disorders manifests itself not in the loss of certain existential moments, but rather in the overall modification of existence is as such. As long as human being exists, none of the constitutive moments of its existence can be absent; being-in-the-world, the lived body and individual being form an inseparable whole that ontologically conditions all ontic changes as described in psychiatric Daseinsanalysis.


In order to comprehend the situation of Binswanger’s patients such as Ilsa, Ellen West or Suzanne Urban, it is definitely not enough to merely empathize with their minds. What is at stake in the search for the meaning of pathological experience is not to describe the mental states of certain individuals, but to discover the ways their worlds are structured. Binswanger emphasizes that phenomenological psychopathology explores not so much subjective experiences as pathologically modified modes of being-in- the-world, which makes it possible to overcome the difference between the mental states with which one can empathize and those with which one cannot. Insofar as the ability to empathize is conditioned “subjectively,” as it varies in each of us, phenomenological description can render pathological experience understandable, even if the world of the mental illness is profoundly different from the commonly shared world, as is the case with various forms of schizophrenia. For the motives and intentions of pathological behavior to become understandable, there is a need to relinquish the semantic context of our everyday world, to find our way around in the significations of the pathological world, and to map the way this world is projected.


The notion of the world-project ( der Weltentwurf), used by Binswanger in this respect, derives from Heidegger’s text Vom Wesen des Grundes, where it denotes the fundamental act by which we project our own possibilities.


This discovery is important especially in the case of psychopathological disorders, in which the significative whole ( das Bedeutungsganze) of the commonly shared world of everyday existence undergoes considerable changes.


What is characteristic of manic excitations, for instance, is the feeling of boundless breadth, freedom and ease that shows everything in bright colors; a world of unlimited possibilities opens where “nothing is impossible”, and therefore nothing is brought to a conclusion, since once one possibility has been seized upon, human being is lured to seize upon ten others that are even more tempting. An individual prone to depression, by contrast, experiences states of utmost dejection, in which all things and people are drowned in monotonous grayness and grime; his/her world is akin to a gutter, a wasteland, or an underground tomb, where all plans are stillborn and where nothing seems worth embarking on. Both the flamboyant world of celestial breadth and the underground world of dirt and decay are poles apart from the social and habitual bonds of the everyday world, in which action is governed by practical purposes and possibilities refer to one another without forming a vicious circle. With regard to the fact that the manic world of glamour and ease usually encompasses a reference to the dark depth of depression, it is of essence to grasp the individuality of existence thus structured on the basis of the alternation of two opposing, and yet innerly bound modes of being-in-the-world.


The psychopathological concepts that focus on the investigation of personality disorders usually expound schizophrenia as the disintegration of personality, i.e. as a disturbance of psychic totality and an inner disorganization of its structures, with special emphasis on the feeling of lability that coerces a schizophrenic to seek support in some idea which could serve him as a point of reference, ridding him/her of his/her inner insecurity. Thus, schizophrenic delusions are conceived of as refuge and buttress of an innerly insecure personality, without raising the question of whence its essential insecurity actually springs. By what else could this insecurity be given if not by the insecure position of human being in the world? Therefore, psychiatric Daseinsanalysis addresses the schizophrenic experience in order to find in its gaps and discontinuities the expression of the fragility and unstableness of being-in-the-world. Explicating the inconsistency of experience observable in most schizophrenics, Binswanger inquires not about its causes, but about its structural conditions, which he finds in the world-project that is infiltrated by destructive intrusions of the Horrible, the Sudden and the Sinister.


The immensity of these destructive intrusions are far beyond whatever is usually an object of fear for human being. Therefore, the basic affective tuning of the schizophrenic world is not fear but anxiety, which unlike fear is not fixed upon a definite entity, but rather encompasses being-in-the-world as a whole. The correlate of the immediate presence of the Horrible, the Sudden and the Sinister, claims Binswanger, is anxiety, since nothing but anxiety can account for the fact that together with its intrusion there occurs the disintegration of the significative structure of the world, with which the individual is familiar.


Anxiety carries the individual away from its familiarity with the world and casts it into uncanniness ( die Unheimlichkeit), where all possibilities of action disappear and all beings fall into insignificance.


Anxiety confronts being-there with the bare fact of its own existence by means of unveiling it in its original uneasiness and precariousness.


The dark side of being-in-the-world announced in uncanniness is experienced by the schizophrenic in its worst form, that is to say, as exposure to the sheer horror of the loss of all possibilities and the rupture all significative connections.


With the so-called normal individual, anxiety, if permitted at all, can always be overcome, whereas in the case of the schizophrenic, it becomes all-encompassing and inescapable. Instead of resolutely accepting the fact of his/her existence as his/her very own possibility, the schizophrenic is, over and over again, cast into a situation where his/ her individuality becomes reduced to the pure capability of suffering. Out of the repeated confrontation with the traumatic experience of “the end of the world” evolves the overall mode of existing, marked by the persistent effort to piece together out of the shattered shreds of the significative whole of the world at least some sort of provisional space, within which one could freely move and breathe.


No matter how perfect safety measures the schizophrenic may take, when turning his/her world into a fortress under strict surveillance, he/she can never escape out of his/her highly uncertain world-project, constantly at the risk of being exposed to disintegration and nothingness.


That is why Binswanger likens the way one of his patients exists to walking on thin ice which can break any moment; in her world, to take one wrong step is to cause everything to tumble into an ice-cold dark depth.


Unlike the person that has, as it were, both feet firmly on the ground, the schizophrenic existence finds itself incessantly on the verge of a dismal abyss, in need to grasp at straws.


The schizophrenic therefore necessarily seems foreign and incomprehensible to a secured existence which confidently relies on the outer world. What comes into play then is condemnation, blaming the schizophrenic’s behavior on his/her imbecility, mental defectiveness, or some other form of pathological deficiency. Understanding the meaning of the original anxiety of being-there ( die Daseinsangst) within the schizophrenic experience, on the contrary, enables us to find the path to the world-project split between the desire for a safe haven where one can feel at home and the horror of falling into the abyss of uncanniness.


With reference to the sinister abyss of anxiety, psychiatric Daseinsanalysis can then unveil the essential insecurity also in the ideal of perfect safety, happiness and harmony to which the schizophrenic existence clings. The idealized world of beauty, peace and order encompasses in its essence a reference to its opposite, to the dark world of uncanniness that is masked only imperfectly and provisionally.


This receives its corroboration whenever the created ideal is doubted, which inevitably throws the person into the subjection to the very contrary of its ideal: the craving after leanness, delicacy and beauty, of which Ellen West keeps dreaming, can become reversed into bestial voracity; the desire for aristocratic nobleness and social recognition that permeates through the life of Jürgen Zünd turns into an uncontrollable downfall into the proletariat and social scorn; and finally the longing for total safety, which forces Lola Voss to make use of security rituals and superstitious practices, cannot ward off the arrival of “something horrible.”


From this Binswanger concludes that the exaggerated ideal to which the schizophrenic clings offers no real way out of his/her situation, but merely conserves his/ her state, preventing it from any possible development. The schizophrenic is incapable of stepping out into the future and seizing new possibilities, since he/she, bound by anxiety, is incessantly drawn down to what has already been. The paradoxical corroboration of this observation is also the suicide in which Ellen West, after 13 years of futile striving, found her last recourse.


Not only those pathological modes of being-in-the-world classified by psychiatry as “psychoses”, but also those belonging to the sphere of “neuroses” can be expounded with regard to the basic anxiety of being-there.


phobia,


compulsive or obsessive states.


Unlike the schizophrenic, whose existence is essentially marked by the collapse of the significative whole of the world and by the striving for a makeshift reconstruction, an individual suffering from phobia maintains a familiarity with the surrounding entities at least as long as he/she manages to evade encountering the object into which all of his/her anxiety has been incarnated. Insofar as the so-called psychosis manifests itself, from the daseinsanalytical perspective, as boundless exposure to uncanniness, neurosis must then be grasped as endangering anxiety and defense against this endangerment.


27In the neurotic’s world, anxiety plays a different role than in the psychotic’s world: whereas in the first case, one seeks to displace and conceal it, or lives it in the form of anxious expectation of frightful evil, punishment, incurable disease and inevitable death, in the other case it is directly exposed to the damaging effects of the awesome uncanniness that deprives his/her existence of all support. Hallucinations or the system of paranoid delusions, in which the whole world is laden with unclear threats and hostile schemes, have their place only within a world-project governed by anxiety. Nevertheless, both psychotic and neurotic disorders are connected by what Binswanger terms heightened susceptibility ( die Empfänglichkeit) to the anxiety of being-there.


Speaking of “the weakness of existence” in connection with schizophrenic individuals, Binswanger has in mind the squeamishness of the temporal structure of their existence that prevents them from maintaining a genuinely open attitude toward the future.


For instance, the temporal continuity of Suzanne Urban’s experience is so labile as to become incapable of integrating any new situation that would pertain to her familial environment.


Even though new experiences from other spheres present no serious problem for her, her family matters must remain the same; above all, no-one must ever fall ill, otherwise the temporal continuity of her existence is in jeopardy. Until her psychotic breakdown occurs, Suzanne Urban worries about the health and prosperity of her relatives, since any grave illness would entail a total catastrophe for herself. Characteristic of the pre-psychotic phase of her existence is her effort to take precautions against the breakdown of the temporal continuity of her existence that leads to the “self-denying” nursing of her ill relatives, especially her mother.


The peculiar form of temporalization, marked by intermittence, sudden leaps and irregularities, is described by Binswanger as urgency ( Dringlichkeit), i.e. as a state of latent catastrophe, in which the individual existence is constantly jeopardized by destructive collisions and turbulences. 29 Instead of an unproblematic, fluent temporalization, the individual must exert all its strength to induce at least some semblance of continuity.


However, the reification and self-alienation in the empty timelessness where nothing happens any more does not by any means pertain to the ontological plane of being-there.


Binswanger outspokenly emphasizes that the ontological structure of being-there, and together with it the overall unity of temporality remains preserved, even if the schizophrenic existence is marked by a considerable degree of disturbance.


The individual settled in the familiarity with the world is thus always capable of overcoming his/ her self-alienation and finding the way back to himself/herself, whereas the schizophrenic remains incapable of coming back to himself/herself, nor is he/she able to find reassurance and security in his/his world.


Every mode of being-in-the-world that uncontrollably lags behind the possibility of an integrated, autonomous existence oriented toward the future appears, against the background of the formal ontological arrangement of being-there, as an example of “miscarried being-there” ( missglücktes Dasein).


A deviation from the norm determined by the ontological composition of human existence is by no means always irreversible. Given that the patient’s being-in-the- world has not deteriorated to the extent to which it would prevent him/her from entering an understanding relationship with the psychotherapist, the therapeutic conversation can endow him/her with the understanding for the fundamental character of his/her world-project and show him/her where and how he/she has confused, deranged or derailed himself/herself in the framework of its structure.


Opposed to the miscarried being-there is the “successful being- there,” which uses being-in-the-world to the maximum of its ontological potential, leading to fulfillment of life. In psychiatric Daseinsanalysis, one can speak of a real fulfillment only when human existence is characterized not only by a bold orientation toward the future, but also by the possibility of love and friendship.


Especially love as absolute openness to the other is considered here an existential moment that requires the ability to overcome one’s own boundaries and rise to new possibilities. It is this ability that the “mentally ill” lack, expending most of their strength for protection against the awesome uncanniness of anxiety. If there is love in schizophrenic individuals, claims Binswanger, then it occurs merely in a deficient form, such as pathological jealousy and the ensuing need to possess the other.


The dual modus of being, manifested in the phenomenon of love, is according to Binswanger something more than purely singular mode of being-in-the-world that does also encompass coexistence with others, but the individual existence never surpasses in relation to them the primary interestedness in itself that springs from its original Jemeinigkeit.


One can either accept this loneliness as one’s own lot that is to be fulfilled by a determined and independent choice of one’s own possibilities, or flee from it by falling prey to the possibilities of the everyday world that are offered to everyone. Whether being-there accepts its original loneliness, or rather in that it yields to the temptation of a convenient dependent existence, governed by how “they” live and by what “they” say, its existence always has an individual character


Only on the basis of the original Jemeinigkeitof existence is it possible to distinguish between both of the modes of being, the authentic and the inauthentic existence.


However, the Grundformen und Erkenntnis menschlichen Daseins states that love is incompatible with both the authentic and the inauthentic existence, as it exceeds the limits of individual existence as such.


The dual modus of being, at which the human being arrives in loving harmony with the other, is allegedly incompatible with being-there that primarily cares about its own existence, while relating, incidentally, as it were, to other beings. If Heidegger terms the structural whole of the individual existence interested in itself as “care,” love must stay outside of the framework of existence thus determined. The very notion of care in the Heideggerian sense, which implies the idea of a cumbersome burden and personal effort, is for Binswanger a denial of the essential character of love.


Further inquiry also leads to the discovery that care does not remain in itself, but is borne by temporality. The structural whole of care, and so the individual character of being-there, is ultimately based on the ecstatic unity of temporality. But since one cannot proceed from individual existence to a single “us,” love cannot be adequately thematized even on the basis of temporality that constitutes the ontological whole of care.


Despite failing to render it immortal, love enables human existence to cut the bonds of its own finitude and, merging with the other, to rise to the infinite. However, when touching the infinite in this way, human existence never reaches beyond time. Rather, what is conferred on the dual being of love is a peculiar temporality that temporalizes itself in the form of eternity. Unlike the empty eternity into which the schizophrenic descends, what is at work here is not the ontic modification of the original ontological unity of temporality, but rather a completely new type of temporality that has the character of the eternal moment.


This is the reason why Binswanger considers love the ontological contrary of anxiety, which exposes the individual existence to uncanniness, giving it the feeling of its own loneliness, insecurity and finitude.


Anxiety appears, especially when the individual has fallen into despair, incessantly having to tackle uncanniness of being-in-the-world, as is corroborated by the casuistry of Ellen West and Jürgen Zünd. 42 Love, on the contrary, extricates us from the snares of uncanniness, as the encounter of two lovers creates the open space of trust and secureness that cannot be shattered even by the inexorable certainty of death. This encounter oscillates as the eternal moment of love, in whose intimacy the lovers find their real home.


What is typical of the dual mode of being, whose temporal basis is formed by the eternal moment of love, is the fact that one no longer exists solely for one’s own sake, but for the sake of “both of us.” In love, we care about “our common” being, which is in Grundformen und Erkenntnis menschlichen Daseins attributed the character of Unsrigkeit. Just as the Jemeinigkeit characterises the individual existence, Unsrigkeit belongs to the loving co-existence 43 In Binswanger’s opinion, it is only on the basis of Unsrigkeit that it is possible to comprehend the integrity of one’s own existence that gives itself to the other in a loving relationship, while accepting it at the same time. 44 The integrity of the loving co-existence is corroborated not in the determined acceptance of one’s own loneliness that springs from the finitude of human existence, but in the faithful sharing of common Unsrigkeit.


Depicting the eternal moment of love and the associated space of trust and secureness, Binswanger goes so far as to speak not of being-in-the-world, but of being-beyond-the-world ( Über-die-Welt-hinaus-Sein). This expression means that the loving existence rises above the purely utilitarian sphere of practical possibilities, offered by the everyday world.


The incessant tension between the understanding being-in-the-world and the imaginative being-beyond-the-world that stands in the primary focus of Binswanger’s anthropological conception is thus translated into his interpretation of the “diametrical opposition” between the madman and the genius.


Unfortunately, however heavily the psychiatric Daseinsanalysis and the resulting concept of love and artistic genius draw upon a vast wealth of experience, this approach cannot stand the test of strict philosophical criteria. Leaving aside the psychopathological dimension of human existence for the moment, one can start by mentioning the critical notes of Paul De Man, who occupied himself with Binswanger’s work in the context of literary theory. His observations summed up in the essay “Ludwig Binswanger and the Sublimation of the Self” concern especially the doubtful role played within Binswanger’s conception by the phenomenon of the self, but what does not pass unnoticed either is the problematic status of imagination, asserted in artistic or loving enthusiasm. 51 Both of these difficult questions, according to De Man, have to do with the overall humanistic orientation of phenomenological description of the creative and the loving mode of being. Cognate with this is the normative tendency manifested in the emphasis on the ideal of a balanced, fully harmonious existence.


De Man arrives at this discovery against the background of Foucault’s archeology of the Western thought which puts phenomenology into the context of the modern episteme. Insofar as the epistemological inquiry undertaken in Les mots et les choses reveals the bond that ties phenomenology to the fate of modern knowledge, what it implies is that even phenomenology is not safe from the fundamental jeopardy designated by Foucault as “anthropological sleep.” What the modern episteme brings into focus of all knowledge is human being, perceived as the empirical object on the one hand and as the transcendental precondition of all knowledge on the other. Therefore, phenomenology must continuously combat the temptation of anthropologism that springs from this empirical-transcendental bifurcation. The basis of anthropologism, according to Foucault, consists in the fact that “[a]ll empirical knowledge, provided it concerns man, can serve as a possible philosophical field in which the foundation of knowledge, the definition of its limits, and, in the end, the truth of all truth must be discovered.” 52 Once we relate the mentioned criterion to Binswanger’s conception, it becomes crystal clear that what we are dealing with here is a model case of falling into the trap of anthropologism.


If phenomenology cannot completely evade its fateful proclivity for anthropologism, this does not mean that it must fall prey to it. This is clearly attested to by Les mots et les choses itself, where phenomenology is grasped as not only an attempt to bridge the empirical and the transcendental regions, but also the place of birth of a new ontology. Despite its rootedness within the transcendental realm of thought, phenomenology falls apart from within and becomes the description of experience, which is still empirical, and ontological inquiry, focusing on the question of being as such.


The lion’s share in this split within the phenomenological project belongs to Heidegger, who decidedly rejects the Husserlian theme of transcendental consciousness, replacing it with the question of being.


On the other hand, the effort to supplement the ontologically strict description of individual being with the phenomenological description of a creative genius and a loving encounter rests on purely empirical foundations, which De Man condemns as an inadmissible blending of the empirical with the ontological subject matter. In spite of relying on the ontological analysis of being-there, Binswanger cannot resist the “tendency to forsake the barren world of ontological reduction for the wealth of experience.” 54 As a consequence, his phenomenological project lapses into the very anthropologism Heidegger seeks to avoid. It is therefore not surprising that Heidegger resolutely distances himself from Binswanger’s psychiatric-erotic orientation. Even though it is Binswanger’s merit that the phenomenological way of thinking had been introduced into the psychiatric realm, his work is assessed in Zollikoner Seminare with extreme severity.


To see how Heidegger rectifies Binswanger’s anthropological conception, it is important to remind ourselves that in Zollikoner Seminare the concepts of being- there ( Dasein) and sojourn ( Aufenthalt) are used as synonyms. As being-there relates not only to its own being, but to being as such, its basic structure lies in the understanding of being. The understanding of being is not only a side, abstract addendum to sojourning with beings, but rather the key to comprehending our sojourn as such, notes Heidegger with an emphasis on the important role played by this fundamental determination in the overall clarification of being-there and its existentials. 55 The description of existential structures, whether of being-in-the- world, care or being-toward-death, is carried out in Sein und Zeit solely with regard to the understanding of being.


Our existence is in the process of transcending only inasmuch as it advances beyond the framework given by beings and relates to the being of beings that radically differs from all beings. Transcendence occurs as advancing from beings in their discoveredness toward being, which guarantees their discoveredness; it can be, in other words, characterized as ecstatic dwelling in the difference between beings and being. Without transcending in precisely this way, without having secured in advance access to being in its utter difference from all beings, we could discover no beings at all. In order to arrive at beings, we must always already advance from beings toward the being of beings.


As beings in their unmediated discoveredness are not that “toward which” our existence advances, but that “from which” our existence advances, a transcendence of this delineation can have nothing to do with the relation of the subjective consciousness to reality. Insofar as the subject-object division is surpassed solely by means of the structure of being-in-the-world in which the understanding of being is omitted, as is the case within psychiatric Daseinsanalysis, the temptation cannot be resisted to consider being-in-the-world only as a new determination of the subjectivity of the subject and regard transcendence only as an act by which the consciousness reaches reality. Both being-in-the-world and transcendence are thus extracted out of the context of fundamental ontology, playing once again the roles of transcendental structures of consciousness, where they serve as a foundation for the empirical investigation of human being.


Failing to think the movement of transcendence through to being itself, Binswanger also misses the phenomenon of disclosedness ( die Erschlossenheit), characteristic of being-there.


Being-there is someone who remains in the openness of being, and only as such can it encoun
