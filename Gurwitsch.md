## Problema Mente-Cuerpo

It is interesting that Gurwitsch speaks in Marginal Consciousness about “the psychic side of the ego” and also of “the somatic aspect.” Against William James he contends in Chapter III that the mental activities are accompanied by somatic processes but are not reducible to them.

## Procesos No-Sensibles

La idea de que procesos no-sensibles (jucios, asociaciones, síntesis, memoria) que son responsables de la organización de datos de la sensación caóticos, no puede evitar un círculo vicioso. Dado que deberían, pero no pueden, imponer una guía en lo caótico mismo. Así, para Gurwitsch debe haber algún tipo de conexión, aunque sea mínima, entre los datos en sí mismos en primer lugar.  Esto es insuperable, dado qué, como Gurwitsch demuestra “as there is no clue to guide the organizing activity when a certain organizational form results for the first time, so none exists on further occasions.”

## Relación inexorable tema-campo temático. 

> Whatever object is our theme, it appears in a thematic field and is experienced as pertaining to a certain context, however indeterminate and inarticulate the context may be.

## El Campo Temático se continua como Orden de Existencia.

To denote the widest range of items and data referred to through the consciousness of indefinite continuation of context, we shall use the term “order of existence.”

By the thematic field, we mean that part of the order of existence immediately adjoining the theme and whose components are experienced to be of direct concern to, and of immediate bearing upon, the theme, of course, it is almost impossible to draw a sharp line of demar-cation between the thematic field and what lies beyond the thematic field and still belongs to the order of existence in question.

Such a line of demarcation cannot be defined in terms of degrees of articulateness since, as previously seen, the thematic field as now defined in the narrower sense admits of all degrees of indistinctness and indeterminateness. What we denote as order of existence is, in the final analysis, an indefinitely extended thematic field.

## Margen - Opinión Schutz

Second, Alfred Schutz had written on January 25, 1952, about the Conclusion of The Field of Consciousness, “The ‘Coda' contains an ‘Overture.' It is my opinion that the especially important constants of marginal consciousness should be developed into a chapter by itself of the book. You are like Mozart, whose most beautiful themes, out of which quite different movements are made, are saved for the coda. The theory of the three constants is very important.” Gurwitsch replied:

You are also quite right that the conclusion is an introduction. The theory of the three constants forms the content of about 150 pages which you read some years ago and about which you provided me with very important notes. Originally that was to have been a further part. But I excised it in order to make a small book out of it, which I will come back to as soon as the main part is completed. When writing these 150 pages the war was still on and neither Sartre nor Merleau-Ponty were accessible to me. I propose to write the new book in French and to call it “Les trois dimensions du Reel.” There the very explicit arguments with Sartre and Merleau-Ponty will have their place. (February 17, 1952)

## CC Marginal - Antecedentes

There are two substantial discussions of the margin and the consciousness of it that antedate Marginal Consciousness. One is the first section of the fourth part of Phänomenologie der Thematik und des reinen Ich (1929) and the other is Chapter III, §9, of Esquisse de la phénoménologie constitutive, an unfinished book based chiefly on lectures at Sorbonne in 1937 and still being worked on when Gurwitsch got out of France in 1940.

## CCC

Aron Gurwitsch pursued a project of research that he derived from Edmund Husserl. The phrase “the field of consciousness” is the best brief designation not only of what he was most concerned with but also of how he approached it. “Consciousness” in this phrase has the broad Cartesian signification it had for Husserl and thus subsumes evaluation and action as well as cognition, but—again, like Husserl; Gurwitsch pursued a theory of the formal, human, and natural sciences and thus intellectualistically emphasized perception and thought. (No estoy del todo de acuerdo). 

There are occasional statements about non-intellectual life and its correlates, e.g., those on “functional objects” and “life-spheres” in The Field of Consciousness, and perhaps his phrase “perceptual world” is often best construed as designating a cultural world of valuable and useful as well as presently existing objects (except in the writings of the last dozen years). Even if the non-intellectual is noticed, there is no sign that the possibility of philosophic evaluation and action parallel to philosophic cognition was recognized, much less accepted, by Gurwitsch. The cognitive nature of his phenomenology appears in this statement:

>Phenomenology aims at ultimate clarification and justification of knowledge, both theoretical and scientific knowledge in the proper sense and that pre-theoretical and pre-scientific knowledge by which we are guided in our life in the world of every day experience, and out of which theoretical and scientific knowledge grows. Knowledge is achieved, on every level, through acts and operations of consciousness. Knowledge is concerned with objects of the most different descriptions: objects pertaining to the perceptual world, inanimate things, animals, fellow human beings, as well as the constructs of science, propositions, numbers, geometrical configurations, also artistic and other activities.

Recognizing and following how objects indicate the acts of consciousness in which such objects are “constituted” is what makes constitutive phenomenology what it is. While passages like that just quoted can be construed to express Gurwitsch's recognition that more than merely cognitive objects are constituted, the traditional philosophical task of knowing about such matters and establishing how they exist is not departed from by Gurwitsch.

The mature Husserl recognized two species of constitutive phenomenology, one transcendental (Cartesian Mediations is a good expres-sion of it) and the other mundane or “in the natural attitude” (Phenomenological Psychology is a good expression of it). It may not be widely recognized that Gurwitsch accepted this distinction, possibly because he devoted most of his effort to transcendental phenomenology. Yet he cites the relevant Husserlian source for the distinction (FC, [401 n. 53]) and classifies Schutz's work on the “finite provinces of meaning” as pertaining to the natural attitude:

Speaking of the self, Schutz considers the human being in the fullness of his humanity, as a mundane existent among mundane existents. Predominance as well as abandonment of the pragmatic motive obviously has meaning only with reference to the human being as a psycho-somatic unity interested in, concerned with, briefly existing and living within, the world. No philosophical question is raised concerning the phenomenological constitution of the existence of either the world or the self considered as mundane.

In the “natural attitude” we are confronted with, and situated within, the world, the paramount reality whose existence we simply accept without even thematizing it.

Whether mundanely or transcendentally, when Gurwitsch reflects he reflects on consciousness as consciousness-of . . . , i.e., as intentional, but his emphasis is on that of which there is consciousness, that which is intended to, just and precisely as it is intended to or, alternatively and in a broad signification, that which presents itself just and precisely as it presents itself to consciousness. In short, Gurwitsch's phenomenology has a “noematic” emphasis, something the phrase “field of consciousness” (rather than “consciousness of field”) nicely connotes.

Within, then, the predominantly “noematic” constitutive-phenomenological perspective, Gurwitsch was most concerned with what in later years he called “organization in consciousness.” This phrase designates the order or structure that matters disclose themselves to noematic reflection as having “autochthonously”; for example, the spatial and temporal dimensions along which, for a given subject, objects are to the left or right, in front or behind, above or below, far or near, now or (in the future or in past) then, etc., are not meanings subjectively imposed on aboriginally chaotic data received from outside. That orientational structure is inherent in the perceptual field. To describe such organization, Gurwitsch drew extensively on Gestalt-theoretical descriptions and revised Husserlian accounts from that of the object to that of the ego.

There are two substantial discussions of the margin and the consciousness of it that antedate Marginal Consciousness. One is the first section of the fourth part of Phänomenologie der Thematik und des reinen Ich (1929) and the other is Chapter III, §9, of Esquisse de la phénoménologie constitutive, an unfinished book based chiefly on lectures at Sorbonne in 1937 and still being worked on when Gurwitsch got out of France in 1940.



In Gestaltist terms, marginal data have no more than merely an “and-connection” with the thematic and relevant items.

In Gurwitsch's revision of Husserl, intentionality is the noetico-noematic correlation, in which there is not only a multiplicity of noemata (i.e., objects just and precisely as they present themselves) in opposi-tion to objects as such (i.e., objects which appear), the two related—for Gurwitsch—as parts and Gestalt-structured whole, but also a multiplic-ity of noeses (or intentional acts of consciousness) vis-à-vis each identical noema.



This same distinction is used in the first paragraph of Marginal Consciousness. The point is that while the recollection is not relevant to the proposition, as a counter-instance, for example, would be, it does have some relation to it, which to wish to take a walk does not. Within the “halo,” Gurwitsch goes on to assert, falls the possibility of reflection, which holds for every mental act as such. All possibilities in this connec-tion are experienced possibilities and the awareness of the possibility for an act to be reflected upon (



Further secondary points are made about the margin in An Outline of Constitutive Phenomenology of 1937–1940.16 For one thing, we are given the example of how the perceived situation becomes marginal when we remember past events. An interesting case here has the perceptually the-matized Louvre in a thematic field of thinking of events in the history of France that occurred there, while the co-perceived passersby on the street are marginal. The passage of phenomenal or inner time, i.e., the tempo-rality intrinsic to experiences and acts of consciousness, is also marginal in that case. The point about one act by virtue of marginal consciousness being distinguishable from another is reiterated, but in relation to the possibility of the act being remembered rather than reflected upon. In the same retrospective vein, the immediately retrotended to (or “retained”) act is considered to be “co-present” not because it itself is present, but because the retrotentive awareness of it is part of the present phase of the stream of consciousness.



Following Husserl in the first edition of the Logical Investigations (1900–1901), Gurwitsch uses “phenomenological ego” to denominate solely the stream of conscious-ness.

Gurwitsch emphasizes that there is marginal consciousness of non-perceptive items, e.g., that which is behind one's back, which can in principle be rendered perceptive (if one turns around).



It is clear that Gurwitsch believed the way cleared for an appreciation of the role of the body by the dismissal of the inwardly transcendent pure ego that Husserl had posited.

ego as act-pole was both subject and object for Husserl, he has made it an object like any other. There may be a question about what Gurwitsch signifies when he calls such an ego an “empirical” object, for pretty clearly he does not mean an actual individual or de facto ego, but also he probably does not intend a mundane ego, since it could also be considered transcenden-tally, at least insofar as it is mental.

Early in Chapter III of Marginal Consciousness he suggests that while the e

when the ego is considered as an empirical object, the body cannot be left out of consideration

It is interesting that Gurwitsch speaks in Marginal Consciousness about “the psychic side of the ego” and also of “the somatic aspect.” Against William James he contends in Chapter III that the mental activities are accompanied by somatic processes but are not reducible to them.

Underline (red), 27/04/2013 23:35:
the mental activities are accompanied by somatic processes but are not reducible to them

However, “[w]ith all due allowance for the indubitable difference between the psychic and the somatic, the Ego may be taken as a unity, as the psychosomatic unity it is given as in everyday experience.”

“Empirical ego” is probably equivalent to “somatopsy-chic subject” in Gurwitsch. That the soma and psyche are parts of a whole does not preclude their being considered separately (as is done in Marginal Consciousness) or the question of their relations being raised

Practically everything phenomenological that has been mentioned thus far, e.g., intentionality, thematization, copresence, self-awareness, and so



forth, pertains to the psychic aspect. One view expressed at the outset of Chapter II seems unique in Gurwitsch's corpus, namely that the phe-nomenological ego may have permanent dispositions. This view deserves to be developed because it strengthens his non-egological conception of consciousness considerably



In the Introduction it is plain that the theory of marginal consciousness was part of the project of The Field of Consciousness: “Originally we had planned to include in this book a study of these orders of existence and of our permanent and persistent awareness of them, since that permanent awareness must be counted among the formal invariants of consciousness. Lest the compass of this book be too broad, we have decided to leave to future publications the investigation of the phenomena in question, since they require detailed analysis and extensive discussion.”

In the body of the text we learn that the name margin is adapted from James, whose notion of margin is divided by Gurwitsch into the-matic field and margin in a narrower signification.

Concerning, furthermore, the whole field of consciousness and its articulation, we are told that “the unity of the margin, the thematic field, and the theme is due entirely to the temporal continuity of the stream of consciousness”

[L]et us define the field of consciousness as the totality of co-present data. Co-presence is understood in a broad sense so as to com-prise not only data which are experienced as simultaneous but also those which are simultaneously experienced though not as simultaneous.”43 (2) The “co-presence” of acts of consciousness can be a matter of immediate successiveness as well as simultaneity.



How an item can at different times be thematic, relevant, or marginal was described in Gurwitsch's dissertation and the emphasis in The Field of Consciousness continues to be on the shift between being relevant and being thematic and vice versa, but there are nevertheless some concrete remarks about how items that have been marginal can seek, as it were, to change status



In continuity with Part VI of The Field of Consciousness, the perspective is ontological, although this is also the case in Marginal Consciousness. Consequently, the margin is not only a domain of irrelevancy but also of contingency

Such contingency pertains to the particular contents of the margin only, for it is necessary that there be a margin and necessary that at least two of the three constant orders of existence be within it.

The central notion of Gurwitsch's ontology is that of “order of exis-tence” and concerning such orders he elaborates something of a regional ontology within which the three constants of the margin play a key role. There are a number of such orders, including worlds of fancy and artistic orders, and there are relationships among such orders such that reality, for example, is prior to the mathematical order. “Order of existence” in general is presented in relation to the familiar concept of “thematic field”:



Reality as used in this passage is spatio-temporal and might more pre-cisely be called “the external perceptual reality”

or “the real material world, the perceptual world.”



That the stream of consciousness is counted as one order of existence among others in what should be glossed as reality “in general” does not conflict with it being the Urregion any more than the ultimate inclusion of the soma in the perceptual world compromises its specificity. Finally, the Conclusion of The Field of Consciousness speaks to the ques-tion of what might be called the “mundanization” of consciousness. This question arises for a specifically transcendental phenomenology, where consciousness has a fundamentally non-worldly status, even though within the natural attitude the same consciousness is found to be sec-ondarily part and parcel of the spatio-temporal world. Though this issue comes up late in Marginal Consciousness, the following later-written pas-sage from The Field of Consciousness is more focused and is of considerable relevance to a difficult question



The theory of the three constants is very important. But there are still others; let me add two more of them: The one, knowledge about my own death (and its correlate, my being cast into the world by my birth), may find its place in the concept of ‘embodied existence.' But the other [is] a great problem for you but not for me: We have intersub-jectivity, i.e., our knowledge of the existence of others, always in the margin (which, of course, also involves communication with others)

Once wondered about in this respect, the subject discussed in Marginal Consciousness and indeed usually elsewhere in Gurwitsch's oeuvre can be recognized to be rather solitary, something he seems sometimes to have been aware of.

Nevertheless he does recognize that an ego can be the cen-ter of a social world like the soma is of the material world

presumably as child to parent, friend to friend, and so on, in analogy to between right and left, and so on. Moreover, the “essentially occasional expressions” discussed in the Appendix are explicitly referable to the situations of oth-ers

Furthermore, as we have seen above, objective time, the relevancy principle of reality in general, requires intersubjective communication. If there were a fourth constant or if others could be related to one of the three constants, a gap would be filled and the position would be stronger, for then the intersubjectivity in which objectivity is constituted would be a permanent object of at least marginal awareness.

how they might be intended to when they are not



present in a self's situation.

for Gurwitsch others are given as somatopsychic (“psychophysical”) objects



Furthermore, others are not originally encountered in cognitive atti-tudes, such as those taken up by psychologists, sociologists, and histori-ans, but in the course of practical activities.



Gurwitsch may have failed to recognize intersubjectivity and others as constant objects of marginal consciousness because, unlike the body, inner time, and the perceptual world, which are always directly given, what Schutz called “directly experienced social reality,” which is com-posed of “consociates”, i.e., others who share both space and time with a self, the latter is not always actual, for plainly one can be alone in one's room with the door shut.

A constant awareness of at least absent others may begin to be plausible when we consider how there can be non-perceptive and, indeed, non-given parts to the perceptual world:



When we perceive desks and houses and streets, even if there are no others about, we have learned to perceive such as humanly pro-duced and thus we perceive them as signaling others in the horizon of the historical and social cultural world in which we live.



In a way, Schutz is wrong if he believed that there is a fourth constant of marginal consciousness which is others who are always given in per-son, but Gurwitsch was also wrong for so often analyzing the field of solitary consciousness as if it were solipsistic. Human Encounters in the Social World corrects that imbalance just as Marginal Consciousness pre-cludes any suspicion that for Gurwitsch consciousness is not embodied. There is a constant and at least marginal consciousness that others, given or not, are or have been in the world as much as one is oneself.

Underline (red), 09/05/2013 20:08:
There is a constant and at least marginal consciousness that others, given or not, are or have been in the world as much as one is oneself.

These three orders make up reality in general, but since it includes others and since all subjects in their non-somatic aspects are fundamentally non-worldly, objective reality is constituted in transcendental intersubjectivity.



There is no limit on the marginal data which may be copresent with a theme at any moment in our conscious life. When we are dealing with a mathematical theorem, for example, items of the most diverse sorts can and do appear within the margin without being integrated into the the-matic field.

Underline (red), 09/05/2013 20:08:
There is no limit on the marginal data which may be copresent with a theme at any moment in our conscious life.



When an object is given in experience, the experiencing subject is con-scious of the object and has an awareness of this very consciousness of the object.

Whatever its object, i.e., the proper or “primary” object or, in our ter-minology, the theme, the act always has a “secondary” object, which is the act itself.

These are the terms in which the self-awareness of every con-scious act has been formulated by Franz Brentano

Following Brentano, we contend that this inner awareness which we have of an act is not a supervenient act distinguished from the former.



What appears, taken in the noematic sense, i.e., precisely and exactly as it actually appears, does not include the fact of its appearance or the awareness of this fact among its elements and constituents. In an exhaustive description of the theme, the inner awareness of the act through which the theme is given does not appear as an ingredient of that which is given.

Thus the self-awareness which accompanies every act of consciousness proves a marginal datum.

From the point of view of the theme, the self-awareness of an act is merely additional, a concomitant of the act.



If it is true, as we are convinced, that there may be no inner awareness of an act unless the act is actually experienced, i.e., exists, it is also true that the act in question cannot exist unless it carries self-awareness with it.

we would have consciousness of the object without being conscious of this fact.

The self-awareness of an act of consciousness thus turns out to be a necessary condition for the existence of this act.5 That every act of consciousness carries self-awareness

self-awareness permanently and necessarily pervades all of our conscious life, so that at every moment of this life we are aware of the act experienced at this very moment. Obviously this does not hold for reflection.

Our conscious life



does not involve a constant reflection upon our mental states.

Acts of consciousness are essentially temporal phenomena. The tempo-rality of consciousness appears in two closely related fundamental facts. In the first place, all acts which pertain to one stream of conscious life stand to each other in temporal relations of either simultaneity or immediate or mediate succession.

examine the present phase of an enduring act. It is not a momentary datum

Were it such a datum, we would have a punctiform experience of an object plus the additional knowledge through mem-ory that this experience had been preceded by a similar one referring to the same object

In point of fact, however, the present phase of an enduring act is pervaded by reminiscences, in the form of “retentions,” of phases which have just passed and thus belong to the immediate or recent past and by expectancies, in the form of “protentions,” of phases to come. All of these retentions and protentions refer to each other and refer also to and converge upon the “present” in the strict sense of a limit phase of coterminousness between the retentions and protentions.

All of these retentions and protentions refer to each other



The psychic Ego presents itself initially as a concatenation and contexture of mental states understood as real psychic events which take place, i.e., are experienced, either simultaneously or in succession.

To be sure, to account for the Ego, one must allow for permanent dispositions, such as attitudes of love, admiration, esteem, hatred, etc., which one person adopts with regard to another person, and for the no less permanent qualities of character and temper, such as likings and dislikings, tendencies, interests, gifts, talents, etc.

Both dispositions and qualities have it in common that they may be said to exist permanently, although none manifests itself uninterruptedly.

The clarification of these systematizations and unifications is not within the scope of the present inquiry. What we are concerned with are mental states and acts of consciousness in temporal sequence and coexis-tence as contents out of which the empirical psychic Ego is built up.

The Ego, considered on its merely psychic side and apart from its corporeity, thus turns out to be nothing other than the stream of consciousness itself.



The pertinence of an act to the Ego is nothing different from the fact that the act in question is actually experienced

Under closer analysis, the pertinence of an act to the Ego proves tantamount to its pertinence to the stream of conscious-ness. The latter is a real whole, displaying itself in time, and composed of mental states as real events and actual happenings. That an act pertains to the stream then means that it is part of this whol

Husserl's earlier theory, established in the Logische Untersuchungen and to which, despite his later development, we are persuaded to adhere, is



quite in line with William James's views on the matter, especially his account of “the unity of consciousness” and “the sense of personal iden-tity.” James explicitly denies that the consciousness of personal identity is the condition for the identity of objects and, therefore, of coherence in the universe.

James traces warmth and intimacy to certain bodily feelings and activ-ities which accompany and pervade all conscious life and constitute what he calls the “inner nucleus” or “central part” of the Self.



the unity and identity of the Ego depends entirely and exclusively upon the intrinsic continuity and coherence of the stream of consciousness and is not due to an entity, agent, or principle external and hence superior to the data to be unified, as though a unity had been bestowed upon these data from without and the data lacked this unity without or prior to the intervention of the unifying agency



In taking the Ego as an empirical object, we are no longer justified in leaving its corporeity out of account.

That would be justified and even required in an egological conception of consciousness. Roughly defined, the task of phenomenology consists in accounting for objects of all kinds in terms of those experiences, acts, and act-systems through which these objects appear to consciousness and present themselves as they are for us, both in common life and in special attitudes, such as those of science, art, etc.

The Ego must be included among the objects to be accounted for. In an egological conception of consciousness, every act is assumed to be experienced as springing or emerging from the Ego and as intrin-sically connected with the latter and this connection, whatever its more precise nature, is assumed to be represented in the act as one of its describ-able features.



class of facts that present themselves permanently

the perceptual world

Absorbed as we may be in this remembered world of the past, the present perceptual world in which at the moment we happen to find ourselves does not vanish from consciousness altogether.

This knowledge, whether perceptual or not, does not interfere with the thematic process or distract the mind from the world of memories in which we are living.

Because the sector of the perceptual world which happens to be given at the moment is of no concern at all to the world of the past with which we are dealing, the appearance of this sector merely accompanies the thematic process of remembrance as a collateral modification of consciousness.



orders of existence

Between this sector of the percep-tual world and the arithmetical universe there is no relationship except the simultaneity of their appearance.

This relationship is not founded upon the material contents of the two orders of existence; it is instead of no concern to either, and, therefore, establishes no intrinsic connec-tion between them. Both orders of existence are there alongside each other, but in their very appearing together they remain unrelated and unconnected.

As soon as the subject withdraws from his mathematical considerations in order to observe some event in his environment or to deal with some other non-arithmetical topic, not only the proposition or problem which had been the theme but also the arithmetical universe as a whole, this very order of existence, vanishes more or less quickly from consciousness.

The perceptual world, on the contrary, is persistently present to consciousness either as a thematic field when the subject deals with perceivable things or otherwise in the form of a marginal concomitant. The perceptual world has thus the privilege of omnipresence, a privilege it shares with the stream of consciousness and the embodied existence, but with no other realm.

Except these three, there is no



other order, scientific, artistic, etc., with whose existence we are at every moment in some form confronted.

Dealing with any theme whatsoever we not only perceive a certain sector of the perceptual world but are also aware of a “more” which as an horizon encompasses this sector



The things are given with greater or lesser determination of detail. The indeterminacy may be almost complete; we know that there are things in our environment beyond the actually perceived sector, but we have no idea whatever what they are and how they look.

Whatever the indeterminacy of the horizon as to its content, the hori-zon has a certain distinctness, also of a greater or lesser degree, as to its type or style.

To whatever degree the details and contents of the horizon are indeterminate, we are conscious of things being there beyond the field of actual perception which, what-ever they are, conform, harmonize, and agree with the things within this field. The horizon is experienced as an extension of the perceived sector along the lines of, and in conformance with, the typical structure of this sector.

Underline (red), 14/03/2014 20:55:
Whatever the indeterminacy of the horizon as to its content, the hori-zon has a certain distinctness, also of a greater or lesser degree, as to its type or style



Horizonal consciousness is never awareness of something utterly and absolutely uncertain and random but is rather of an extension along determinate lines, however schematically delineated.

It must be noted that every hori-zonal consciousness, even the most distinct and determinate, terminates finally in the and so forth which expresses the minimum of distinctness.



But neither the explicatory nor the exploratory clarification can ever succeed completely. It is impossible ever to realize a state of conscious-ness from which all the implicitness, vagueness, and indistinctness of horizonal awareness is entirely removed.

We become aware of the infinite openness of the horizon and of the “world” as the all-embracing horizon which extends infinitely in the performance



of the process of clarification.

In being performed, the process of either explicatory or exploratory clarification reveals itself as an infinite task; obviously, what is true of actual “moving along” also holds for moving in imagination and representation.

Parts and sectors of the world may be thematized and clarified, but not the world in its entirety. As Landgrebe puts it, the world is not one object among others.



As may be seen from James's example, the phenomenon of context is founded upon relevancy. Here the context is founded on the relations which exist between the sector actually perceived and the things appear-ing on the horizon on account of their material contents.



As far as the perceptual world is concerned, objective temporality proves the most general and most fundamental form of relevancy, i.e., that form which underlies and is a condition for the other more definite and more specific forms.

Underline (blue), 08/03/2014 20:40:
objective temporality

In its very delineation of the style of the horizon, the per-ceived sector is immediately perceived as pervaded by this style. Given as the



center of reference and relevancy with respect to the horizon, the perceived sec-tor presents itself, by the same token, as pertaining to and integrated into the encompassing horizonal context.

Each particular thing appearing in perception has its particularization within the general framework of the world, the latter understood as the all-inclusive horizon

Among the facts which play a part for the awareness of our embod-ied existence, we have ascribed preponderant importance to kinesthetic experiences of all kinds,

such as the awareness of our bodily posture, experiences of the movements of our body, our sense organs, and our limbs, etc., all movements which we are actually performing or feel free to perform if we choose to do so.

Underline (blue), 04/03/2014 19:29:
preponderant importance to kinesthetic experiences of all kinds

All of these kinesthetic experiences are connected with and related to the awareness of the real world, whether perceptual or horizonal, regardless of whether one or the other is cur-rently in the thematic field or they both fall into the margin.

in order to perceive the details of a thing more closely or else to survey it as a whole in its broad outlines, we may and do come nearer to or move further away from it

a perception or a sequence of perceptions is not merely given alongside the kinesthetic experiences, as if there were no relation between them except their simul-taneous occurrence



By intervention we do not mean in any way an inter-mingling of perceptual appearances and kinesthetic experiences. Both orders of data present themselves as coherent and closed. Nevertheless, there is a certain correspondence between elements of the one order and elements of the other.

We must keep in mind, however, that except in a special attitude there is no explicit, much less formulated, consciousness of the correspondence between perceptual appearances and kinesthetic experiences any more than there is of the variations of the former in dependence on the latter.

When the special attitude in question is not adopted, there is still a highly automatic adjustment of our movements to the things appearing in perception.

Underline (red), 08/03/2014 20:40:
highly automatic adjustment of our movements to the things appearing in perception

we change our point of view with regard to a perceived thing in order to gratify a perceptual interest in it

the fact that the things presented in perception not only motivate but also and chiefly guide our movements



When we walk, we are aware not only of our walking but also of our walking in a certain direction. This direction is a direction in perceptual space

Perception's guidance of the movements consists in the movements taking place on the grounds of and in accordance with what is offered by per-ception

Certain things are to be found in this direction. Some of these things are given in actual perception and of others we have a more or less indeterminate and indistinct horizonal awareness



What we have expounded in the preceding chapter about the all-embracing world-horizon which encompasses every field of perception and every perceivable object applies to our body as well. Like any other perceivable object, our body appears in experience under the perspective of the percep-tual world and derives its positional index as a “worldly” or “mundane” existent from this horizon

Being brought into connection with the perceptual world, how-ever, conscious acts do acquire the character of natural and real facts, i.e., facts which take place in the real perceptual world, and are aroused by objective physical events acting as stimuli through the medium of the nervous system

They occur at definite moments of objective time and stand, therefore, in temporal relations to material things and events and they may even be assigned, although indirectly and secondarily, a place in objective space, naturally the place which the body of the subject hap-pens to occupy at the time.

It is under the aspect of this connection,



i.e., its integration into nature, that consciousness is studied in psy-chology, whereas, for reasons which cannot be discussed here, in phe-nomenology this connection is deliberately and purposely left out of consideration.

Reflecting on the Ego and bringing out the implications of its exis-tence, we can render explicit what Husserl calls the “natural attitude”

We ascertain our permanent awareness of our no less permanent belief in the existence of the real (perceptual) world and of ourselves as parts or mem-bers of this world. As we shall see presently, the perceptual world appears in experience organized with reference to the body. The existence of the perceptual world is taken for granted. To be sure, the belief in question may be challenged with regard to this or that particular object.

But this challenge and eventual correc-tion concerns only particular beliefs, i.e., beliefs in particular objects; it does not concern the belief in the perceptual world at large



In addition, that the belief in the existence of the perceptual world is far from being a mere “prejudice” appears from the fact that the evidence from which it derives its certainty is permanently on hand. This evidence consists in the permanent presence to consciousness, at least in marginal form, of the three orders of existence which have been discussed earlier in this investigation, viz., the perceptual world and the other sets of facts which, when grasped in the appropriate attitude, lead to the apprehension of the Ego. Because at every moment of conscious life (whatever our special attitude and the subject matter of our thematic activity), we are aware of a certain seg-ment of the stream of consciousness, of our embodied existence, and of the perceptual world, the belief in the existence of this world and the apprehen-sion of ourselves as pertaining to it as mundane existents are permanently present to consciousness. Thus the facts treated here under the heading of “marginal consciousness” prove to be the root of what Husserl calls “the natural attitude”.



Bertrand Russell has studied words of this sort under the heading of “egocentric particulars.” He limited his discussion to the word “this,” because, he thought, every other “egocentric particular” can be defined in terms of “this.”



General concepts have instances.

Once an object is rec-ognized to be an instance of a general concept, it remains an instance forever and the term in question may always be applied to the object. But “this” sometimes may and sometimes may not be applied to the same object.

Confronted with the paradox that “this” may not only be applied to one object at a time but to different objects at different times, Russell turns to the circumstances under which “this” is used rather than “that.” In both cases there is a verbal reaction to a stimulus, i.e., a reaction which involves the innervation of certain muscles so that a sentence is emit-ted. This verbal reaction may be immediate or delayed. If it is delayed, the effect of the stimulus is not an immediate motor impulse and ver-bal response; rather, this effect is stored in “some kind of reservoir” and then subsequently released by a new stimulus

Whereas the immediate verbal reaction begins with the words “that is. . .,” a delayed reaction begins with the words



“that was . . ..” According to Russell, “egocentric particulars” merely des-ignate causal relations between that which is stated and the stating of it.

Taken in isolation, they have no meaning at all.



The meaningfulness of a word consists not in its being emitted subse-quent to the stimulus but also, and mainly, in the reference to and thus the denotation of the stimulus.

Whereas all three reactions which we have considered may be said to be alike in that they result from the stimulus, the utterance of the word “this” is distinguished with respect to the other two reactions in that it refers to the stimulus.


## Relatividad respecto a un Sistema de Referencias y respecto a una Escala de Referencia. 

> In the case of near and far, there is still another relativity. Sitting at my desk, I may say that the books on the shelves are near; living in New York, I may say that Philadelphia is near. But the nearness in the first example is not the same as in the latter. A relativity of this kind is also involved in words like hot, cold, great, small, fast, slow, etc. In the tropics, "hot" weather means something different from what it means in a moderate climate; a "fast" mode of transportation today is not what it was a hundred years ago; etc. But these words do not imply a relativity with respect to a referential system. Here the reference is rather to a certain scale that is, as it were, graduated with regard to what passes in various fields of experience as the average standard. This relativity with regard to a scale derives from the fact that the average standards are not the same in all fields of experience and that, furthermore, they vary according to the general environment, both natural and cultural (cf. Husserl, Erfahrung und Urteil §46). In what follows we will be concerned only with relativity with regard to a referential system and not with that regarding scales and average standards. (GW. Tomo 3, pg. 520, infra). 

En su discusión del problema de los __indéxicos__ Gurwitsch trae a colación una dificultad extra respecto al significado ocasionalmente ambiguo de ciertos términos. La __ambigüedad esencial__ de los indéxicos, o de los partículares egocéntricos, que discute en este artículo, no es propia solamente de ellos, sino también de todos esos términos cuyo significado es relativo a una totalidad más amplia. De la misma manera en qué la ambiguedad de los indéxicos es tal debído a una suerte de significado primario, puramente formal, que se dota de contenido realizando entonces un significado secundario, puramente material; lo mismo pasa con términos como _cerca_, _lejos_, etc. La cercanía o la lejanía no son relaciones que puedan ser definidas objetivamente, para todas las circunstancias en que dichas relaciones puedan aparecer. Esto es, no puede dotarselas de una materialidad en terminos precisos de metros. Y, en caso de que eso pueda hacerse, el signiicado que se fije será siempre relativamente a tales o cuales circunstancias. 

En algún sentido, sin embargo, la variabilidad de un significado en torno a una __escala de referencia__ es todavía más complicada que la variabilidad de los indéxicos o de los egocentricos particulares, dado que no hay una guía coherente para dotar de materialidad, de contenido el significado primario y formal de estos términos. Si bien la expresión _en frente mío_ es ambigua debido a que puedo mover mi cuerpo y entonces cambiar mi sistema de referencias, una vez localizado yo en el espacio el significado de la expresión _en frente mío_ queda completamente determinado. En cambio, la determinación del significado de _lejos_ o _cerca_ no cuenta con reglas tan precisas. De hecho, puede reemplazarse _lejos_ y _cerca_ por expresiones no-cualificadas. Así: "Aquí me encuentro lejos de CABA" puede sustituirse por "Aquí me encuentro a 9 Km de CABA". 

Tenemos, pues, expresiones ambiguas cuyo sentido puede determinarse siguiendo una regla estricta, y expresiones ambiguas sin tal regla. _En frente mío_ y todas las expresiones ocasionales cuentan con una regla que determina su significado material, dicha regla es justamente el significado formal de estos términos. Por otro lado, también hay expresiones ocasionales cuyo significado formal no explicita claramente cuál es la regla a seguir. 

Ahora bien, más allá de la regla, en ambos casos el significado de los términos queda determinado por el contexto vivencial-perceptivo del hablante que emite la expresión. Así, _en frente mío_ se determina en relación de las coordenadas de mi _Leib_, etc. Esto no siempre es el caso sin embargo. La  expresión _yo_ tiene como significado formal _sujeto de la emisión_ (mientras no sea un contexto oblicuo), y como significado material tal o cuál nombre propio. Su significado material no es estrictamente determinado por el horizonte en este caso, excepto para el receptor de tal emisión. Para el propio hablante, el contexto no hace en absoluto a la determinación del significado del término _yo_, así que acá hay que tener cuidado. 

Quizá sería mejor hablar de "amgibuedad" para las primeras, y de "relatividad" para las segundas, aunque está elección de términos técnicos no sea del todo feliz. Por "ambigüedad" entenderíamos la propiedad de aquellas expresiones cuyo significado material es determinado por su significado formal; mientras que por "relatividad" entenderíamos aquellas expresiones en donde la variabilidad del significado material no puede determinarse completamente. 

La "relatividad" de estos significados sería, justamente, lo que permite la retórica. "Estoy lejos", dice A. "No, no estás tan lejos", dice B. "¿Cómo no voy a estar lejos si tengo como dos horas hasta ahí?", dice A. "Dos horas no es tanto, dale", dice B. Y así pueden seguir. B trata de desarticular el significado material de _lejos_ que le da A a la expresión, cosa que puede hacer justamente por la relatividad del significado de esta expresión.

> It is owing to the permanent awareness, at least in marginal form, of the perceptual world that the understanding of essentially occasional expressions never involves any difficulty and that there never arises any doubt about the specific meaning which any of these expressions happens to have in a given case. Essentially occasional expressions have their phenomenal origin, i.e., their underlying experiential basis, in the present awareness, at least in the marginal form, of the three always-present orders of existence in their mutual interrelations, namely the stream of consciousness, embodied existence, and the perceptual world.
