# Nicolas de Warren: Husserl and the Promise of Time


## Manuscritos de Bernau

Entre 1917 y 1918, Husserl, con un hijo fallecido y el otro herido en la 1 GM, y vacacionando en Bernau, prosigue sus analisis fenomenológicos respecto a la constitución del tiempo, "el más dificil de todos los problemas que confrontan a la mente humana" (Hua XXIV, 255: Einleitung in die Logik und Erkenntnistheorie).

Descripción centrada en el eje de una __renovación incesante del ahora__. La emergencia de cada ahora toma la forma de una esperanza primordial, que __espera__ otro ahora aún por venir __en la estela de__ (in the wake of) un ahora ya pasado. Esta estructura temporal es la fundación de la posibilidad de un mundo de la experiencia humana inteligible y, por ende, significativo.

En 1923 y 1924 Husserl publicó en el Jornal Japones Kaizo, tres enseyos sobre el tema de la __renovación__. Estos apuntan a una renovación de la cultura europea a través del advenimiento de la filosofía como ciencia rigurosa, en la perspectiva del proyecto de la fenomenología trascendental. Similar entonces a Krisis, en donde se llama a una reaparición de la razón (Besinnung). Pero, hacia atrás, estos ensayos también apuntan hacia las LU, y en especial hacia los Prolegómenos. 

## Agustin

Agustin es quien por primera vez introduce las dificultades de la pregunta "¿Qué es el tiempo?", y también, quien descubre su __entrelazamiento__ (entaglement) con la pregunta "¿Quién soy yo?" (Y así, puede pensarse toda la filosofía de Heidegger cómo una reactivación de una pregunta formulada, primigeniamente, por Agustín). 

En las Confesiones Agustin señala que con esta pregunta, yo me he vuelvo una pregunta para mi mismo, desconocido para mi mismo a la luz de la cuestionabilidad del tiempo. La pregunta "¿Qué es el tiempo?" es en realidad una doble pregunta: ¿Cómo es que la conciencia del paso del tiempo - la desafiante percepción de un tiempo que es, que ya no es, y que está por ser - es posible? ¿Qué debo entender acerca de mi mismo como el ser para quien el tiempo es una pregunta?

## Tiempo y Subjetividad

Lo importancia del tema de la temporalidad se ata al hecho de que lo fundamental de la temporalidad señala a aquello mismo que es lo fundamental de la subjetividad trascendental, osea, su temporalidad, y esto revela lo específico de la fenomenología trascendental. Lo que Husserl intentá estudiar ya desde Ideas es "la subjetividad pura", tema que para de Warren sigue siendo fundamental, a la vez que la muerte de la subjetividad equivale, para él, a una evasión de un tiempo que es, en sí mismo, inescapable. 

Para de Warren el estudio de Husserl no puede limitarse, como dijo alguna vez Ricouer, a su obra publicada. Pero es necesario, también, considerar la complejidad editorial de su obra. Apartura de la obra, a pesar de la jerga (el fenomenológico). 

## Secciones

Promesa del Tiempo: 3 Secciones.

1) Conciencia del pasaje del tiempo, y comprehensión de la subjetividad trascendental. En el capítulo 1, "El ritual de la clarificación", se repone el marco de la fenomenología trascendental con su enfasis en la centralidad de la intencionalidad para la comprensión de la subjetividad en su función constitutiva del mundo. 

Chapter 2, “A rehearsal of difficulties,” examines what Husserl understood as the problem of time-consciousness, prior to its transcendental inflection, by investigating Brentano's theory of “original association,” which served as the point of departure for Husserl's phenomenological analysis. Chapter 2 reconstructs Brentano's theory of original associ-ation on its own terms, primarily on the basis of his lecture-courses on descriptive psychology from the 1880s, and examines its relationship to other key concepts in Brentano's descriptive psychology (e.g., intentional relation and inner consciousness). In addition to under-standing Brentano's struggle with the perception of time, chapter 2

stresses the role of Stern's concept of “mental presence-time” and his critique of “momentary consciousness” for the formation of Husserl's thinking, especially in shaping the sense in which time-consciousness becomes a problem for phenomenological reflection. Whereas chapter 1 moves from the problem of phenomenology to the problem of time-consciousness, chapter 2 moves from the problem of time-consciousness to the problem of phenomenology.

In section two, I explore in detail what Husserl identified as “the great problem” of phenomenological or inner time-consciousness (the temporality of the stream of consciousness) and the self-constitution of absolute time-consciousness.


In section three (chapters 6 and 7), I expand the reach of my interpretations of time-consciousness developed in section two. Chapter 6, “The lives of Others,” considers Husserl's refutation of transcendental solipsism as the formulation of his refutation of idealism as well as the constitution of the Other as an alter-ego, as developed in the Cartesian Meditations. I argue for a significant correc-tion in Husserl's phenomenology of the Other that brings to bear insights gained from the reflections on time-consciousness developed in the Bernau Manuscripts.


The Promise of Time presents an interpretation of Husserlian pheno-menology; as such, I allow myself to be led as much as I allow myself to lead. As with any interpretation, I am deliberately selective and critically self-serving; selective since my aim is not to deliver a compre-hensive treatment, but to plot a course through Husserl's thinking; self-serving since my trajectory reflects the choices of paths taken, or not-taken. Throughout the writing of this book, I have been mindful of my conviction that a philosopher should neither over-simplify the complexity of a problem nor over-complicate the economy of its solution.


THE RITUAL OF CLARIFICATION

Husserl was a philosopher who believed that the course of Western history could never forsake the idea of philosophy first ushered into the world with Greek thinking, even as he recognized that he came to philosophy in an historical epoch in which that unique window of human possibility was rapidly, and perhaps entirely, coming to a close. From the seminal Logical Investigations to the unprecedented Crisis of the European Sciences, Husserlian phenomenology struggled to define itself against the current of an age that unthinkingly abdicated a responsibility towards the highest perfection of reason in the name of a reason paradoxically called modern. Husserlian phenomenology is therefore best approached as an untimely provocation, the thrust of which is encapsulated in the charge that “the spirit of radicalism has been lost under the title of philosophy” (Hua VIII, 10). This call to radicalism takes on different forms. Its most visible banner is the motto “back to the things themselves” that commonly informs our view of Husserl's enterprise, to the extent that the generalized term “phenomenology” is often taken as synonymous with any invocation of lived experience and the “first person point of view” in contemporary philosophical discourse. The primary concern, however, that animates Husserlian phenomenology is neither “lived experience” nor “con-sciousness” as such, but a problem first broached in the Logical Investi-gations that continually defined, with increased sophistication and breadth, the center of Husserl's gravity, and to which he untiringly


how is knowledge possible?

returned once again in the unfinished Crisis of the European Sciences:

That the problem of knowledge is central to Husserl's enterprise should not surprise us, since any significant claim to philosophy cannot avoid the quest for what could also be called the “thinkability of the world,” the way in which the world, as the ordered totality of all possible experience, becomes rediscovered through the origin of its intelligibility. This primary concern with the problem of knowledge must be taken in its transcendental significance as the issue of how knowledge is at all possible or, in the formulation just proposed, of how experience is at all “thinkable,” open as the possibility of being known. Yet Husserl does not accept the meaning of this transcenden-tal directive without question, despite its familiarity in its Kantian expression or in the derived neo-Kantian form that shaped Husserl's academic environment. Instead, Husserl invokes a broader imperative to refashion the possibility of knowledge, from the beginning and as a beginning, for the first time in the history of philosophy. Though this ambition might strike us as paradoxical, or even absurd, Husserl's enterprise is predicated on the claim that genuine philosophical thinking, as the knowledge of how knowledge is at all possible, has yet to begin. As Husserl remarks, “I do not say that philosophy is an incomplete science. I say more directly that philosophy is not at all a science, that it has not at all begun to become a science.”

On this point, Heidegger is entirely correct: phenomenology is neither a school nor a movement that may or may not be historically surpassed. Phenomenology is nothing less than the permanent possibility of thinking itself.

1 “Philosophie als strenge Wissenschaft,” 8 [167]. 2 Ibid., 8 [167]

Husserl in this fashion announces the enterprise of phenomen-ology as a protest against the false entitlements (and enticements) of thinking we know how to answer questions we in fact do not yet know what it means to ask. If philosophy has genuinely yet to begin, it is because we have yet to learn how to articulate the traditional questions of philosophy in a rigorous fashion. In Husserl's view, “the genuine sense of philosophical problems has not once been brought to scientific clarity.”

Under the mantle of the transcendental reduction, Husserl's methodological response to the unscientific condition of philosophy can be characterized as patiently recasting the basic questions of philosophy, taken in the traditional ontological form of “what is such-and-such,” into transcendental questions of givenness, of how, and under what conditions, objects with a determinate sense of being so-and-so are at all given to consciousness (this perceptual object as being so-and-so, this imaginary object as being so-and-so, etc.)


Brentano divides presentations (Vorstellungen) into two kinds: fun-damental or sensible presentations and “superimposed” presentations ( judgments and affections of pain/pleasure) that are based on funda-mental presentations in which an object is at all presented, or given, to consciousness. In the ontology of parts and wholes that shapes Brentano's psychological classification, these three kinds of presenta-tions are defined as “separable [ablo ¨sbare] parts” of consciousness since any mental phenomenon can be separated from each other (i.e., the givenness of one kind does necessarily entail the givenness of another kind) as well as from consciousness as such, in so far as every presen-tation is an occasional event, a “wave” in the stream of consciousness.

As with every kind of mental phenomenon, a sensible presentation is characterized as an intentional relation: “the sensing is real, the object of sensation is not-real.”

A sensation is any aspect of an object's


sensible appearance that is immediately “experienced” (erlebt) and given in an intuition (Anschauung); due to its intentional character, a sensation is not a “simple state” or “feeling,” but a “manifold of parts” (eine Mehrheit von Teilen) or a “plurality” (Vielheit) (DP, 135; 137

[144; 146]). Within this manifold of parts, Brentano further distin-guishes two distinct, yet non-separable parts or “moments” belonging to sensible presentations: spatial location and quality. Under the aspect of quality, Brentano understands a relative degree of brightness or darkness as well as a relative degree of what Brentano terms Sa ¨tti-gung or Ungesa ¨ttigung. Spatial location and quality are distinctive moments of sensation in the sense that they “contribute reciprocally, and interpenetrate, to the individualization of sensations” (DP, 17 [20]). In addition to spatial location and quality, sensations also possess a temporal character; each sensation appears in a temporal continuum, or finite stretch of time (Zeitstrecke). Yet, the temporal character of a sensible presentation is not a distinctive part of sensation, but a modification of the manner in which a sensation is given (“in der Art vera ¨ndert auftreten”)

46

(DP, 16 [19]). Expressed in Brentano's terminology, a sensation's temporal duration is an “enriching attri-bute” (bereichernde Bestimmung) in contrast to the “determining attri-butes” (determinierende Bestimmungen) of spatial location and quality. Determining attributes pertain to the content of sensation whereas enriching attributes, or what Brentano also calls “modifying attri-butes” (modifizierende Bestimmungen), modify in a total manner the way in which a sensation is given. The temporal character of a sensa-tion, for example, a musical note, as “just-past” does not change the content of the sensation: the note of middle-C remains as much middle-C through its duration. Moreover, Brentano argues that the temporal determinations of “earlier than” and “later than” cannot be considered as true predicates of an object since a sensation that is past cannot, by definition, be said to exist. Zeitlicheit is neither a sensation

Cf. Brentano's rejection of Ernst Mach's argument in his Beitra ¨gen zur Analyse der Empfindungen (and in Erkenntnis und Irrtum) that experience is composed of sensations from which complex objects are constructed. These sensations include color, sounds, etc., but also “spaces” and “times” (Ra ¨umen and Zeiten). Mach argues for the existence of “time-sensation” or “time-moment” (Zeitempfindung or Zeitelement) as the sensible ground for the intuition of time (Zeitanschauung). Brentano rejects this idea of a “time-sense” (Zeitsinn) and its “time-sensation” (Zeitempfindung). As Brentano remarks: “Eine Zeitempfindung kann es nicht geben” (U ¨ber Ernst Machs “Erkenntnis und Irrtum,” ed. R. Chisholm and J. Marek [Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1988], 143).


nor a distinctive part of sensation; yet temporality is always given along with, and in this sense, follows, the actuality of sensation, since an actual sensation is given with a temporal duration. On the one hand, Brentano argues that there is no sensation of time; as Hume already recognized: “The idea of time is not derived from a particular impres-sion mixed up with others, and plainly distinguishable from them, but arises altogether from the manner in which impressions appear to the mind . . .”

47

On the other hand, the idea of time is not, as Hume argued, based on the succession of impressions, since this presupposes the duration or “temporality” of each individual sensation.

48

The upshot for Brentano is that not every “sensible presentation” (sinnliche Vorstellung) is composed solely of a “sensation-presentation” (Empfin-dungsvorstellung). The concept of sensibility (Sinnlichkeit) is not exhausted by the concept of sensation (Empfindung); in the example of hearing a temporally extended sensation (e.g., a musical note), the duration of the note is composed of the actual sensed content as now as well as the sensed content as “just-past.” The sensible presentation of the sensed content as “just-past,” however, is itself not derived from, or based on, an actual sensation (Empfindung); yet this sensible pre-sentation is likewise not itself given independently of an actual sensed content as now, to which it is attached, and in this sense “follows,” much as time “follows” the mobile (the moved object) in Aristotle's account. This discovery of the origin of time in sensible presentation that is, on the one hand, not derived from a sensation, yet, on the other hand, not itself given without a sensation also informs Brentano's consideration of self-consciousness or “inner consciousness,” to which we shall now turn as the final implement in our approach to the theory of original association or proteraesthesis.
