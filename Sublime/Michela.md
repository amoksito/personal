La Estética Trascendental

La sensibilidad recibe los objetos, el entendimiento los transforma en conceptos. Ya en Kant, nada puede sernos dado que no remita, en última instancia, a la sensibilidad. 
Todo esto se llama intuiciones. Pero tenemos un par de intuiciones PURAS: el espacio y el tiempo. Así, a la hora de pensar espacio y tiempo en Husserl, debemos ver si pensarlos como intuiciones puras o no, y sino es el caso, si se trata de algo originario, o tambien derivado de la experiencia sensible. Osea, INTUICIONES PURAS = FORMAS PURAS DE LA INTUICIÓN (SENSIBLE).

¿Cómo debemos entender la relación entre __espacialidad__ y __temporalidad__? ¿Son dos dimensiones de la experiencia simplemente paralelas, o debemos considerarlas más bien cómo facetas de la experiencia profundamente interconectadas?

Husserl suele considerarlas dimensiones independientes, capas diferentes de la experiencia a las que busca reconstruir mediante un analisis basado en el concepto de __estratificación__, parte de su concepción "arquitectónica" de la experiencia, y que presuponen la relación ontológico-formal de __fundamentación__ entre partes.

Pero, la fenomenología posterior ha tratado de vincular más profundamente las esferas de la temporalidad y la espacialidad. Richir bajo el concepto de "esquematismo fenomenológico", y Welton (2002) señalando la co-originalidad de la espacialidad y la temporalidad con respecto a la experiencia kinestecica y temporal de la subjetividad corporal. También Larrabee se ha ocupado de esto.

__Todo complejo (complex whole)__: Let’s take, for the sake of clarification, the simple case of just two parts, e.g., α and μ. In a foundational relationship, one of the two parts, say α, cannot exist except within such an encompassing whole. As such, it is a nonindependent moment (as opposed to an independent piece) within a complex whole. That is to say, in order to exist, α needs to be supplemented by (or founded upon) μ. If the foundation is univocal, then this relationship is not reversible, i.e., μ can in principle exist apart from the more encompassing whole and, within such a whole, it is founding with respect to α. This can be extended as to encompass a plurality of parts and their respective relations.


Notably, within the domain of sensible experience, Husserl considers material and spatial constitution, involving transcendent perception, as grounded upon temporal constitution, which can be abstractedly considered at the level of pure immanence. This architectonic of experience can be exemplified both noematically, by referring to the three layers of intentional objects in their foundational relation ( res temporalis; res extensa; res materialis), and noetically, by referring to acts and to the syntheses implied in the constitution of each layer.


Thus, assuming the regional ontology of the “thing” as a guiding thread to explore the structure of constitution, in Ideas I, Husserl argues that, in the most basic sense, the thing is apperceived as res temporalis, i.e., as a sensible unity of duration. The apperception of the thing as res extensa, i.e., as an extended and localized unity, is considered to be grounded upon the constitution of res temporalis. Finally, the constitution of the thing as res materialis, or as a concrete unity which is part of causal relationships determining its possible alterations, presupposes, or is grounded upon, both previous layers.


Similarly, considering the example of the perception of a violin note, in Ideas II, Husserl argues that the sound can be considered as a material “thing”, i.e., as causally produced by the vibration of the violin cords. As such, it has its reality, independently of my being in the same room or in another one, of my being closer to or farther from the violin, etc. Abstracting from material-causal relationships, the violin note is still given as a spatial phantom, i.e., as originating from a specific location and as spreading-out in space. Finally, apart from such spatial determinations, the sound is given as a pure sense datum, which spreads-out temporally.


leading hypotheses of this work: although the singular layers and moments of experience can be abstractedly described as to their own specific features, such a description is nevertheless based upon the understanding of experience as a complex whole, the moments of which can certainly be analytically distinguished, and yet cannot be separated from one another. As we shall see, this rather general claim concretely applies to both the relationship between the sensible and the predicative order, and, within the sensible order, to the relationship between spatiality and temporality. As a consequence, besides the distinction and the description of the constitutive features of each layer or moment of experience, an analysis of their interconnection within the whole of experience is also required. Focusing on the relationship between the spatial and the temporal dimensions of sensible experience, in this book I wish to contribute to such an analysis. Besides emphasizing the stratification, the relatively few statements Husserl makes concerning the relation between spatiality and temporality concern the parallelisms and the analogies between the constitution that is accomplished in both domains.


The world familiar to us from our experiences, our life world, is in every present; and in every survey is found the unity of spatiotemporality, which is the unity of our experience, in the unified world which is ours. It is ours not only as flowingly present, but as our spatiotemporal world of experience. Thanks to recoverable pasts given through memory and also to expectations which predelineate the living future for us it is a thoroughly typified world. All that exists within it, whether known or unknown, is an object of experience within the form: an A, and, this A.


The stratification in this context can be retraced to the foundational relationship between the constitution of res temporalis and of res extensa. The analogies, on the other hand, concern specific aspects of the constitution of the spatial and the temporal thing. Such an inquiry is based upon an abstracting procedure that aims at isolating for the sake of description the spatial from the temporal dimension. However, considering the outcomes of such analyses will highlight once more the limits of a mere analogical and abstracting consideration. First, it appears to be questionable whether we can really consider temporal objects apart from their localization. Secondly, the constitution of the spatial thing implies temporal syntheses, so that, abstracting from temporality, we can provide only a limited description of spatial constitution. Thirdly, the abstracting procedure does not allow us to account for the constitution of space as the form of sensible appearance. Being based upon movement, the latter also requires both spatiality and temporality.


If we were satisfied with the acknowledgement of certain parallelisms at different levels between the phenomenology of time and space and with the foundational relation between them, we would still consider the two domains of sensible constitution as self-enclosed: in each of the two layers, constitution would be accomplished independently of what happens within the other domain. Yet, can we really assume that this is the case? The answer to this question can only be provided by concrete phenomenological analyses. For this reason, the third part of this book will concentrate more directly on what phenomenology does when it describes experience.


Besides, the analyses concerning bodily self-experience, and particularly those referring to tactile experience, allow us to shed light on the constitutive ambiguity of the lived-body, as being on the threshold between self-affection, and hetero-affection. Eventually, considering bodily experience and its indispensable role in sensible constitution will allow us to further rephrase the question of facticity, understood as the necessity of an experiential Faktum, which we have encountered in the first part of this book.


The conclusion of Formal and Transcendental Logic, one of the later texts of Husserl’s, offers one of the most concise and perspicuous outlines of the project of the transcendental aesthetic. This text has both a programmatic and a recapitulating flavor. It is programmatic, since it clearly hints to the still to be accomplished project of a new transcendental logic, conceived as the logic of the absolute science. 1Yet, it is also recapitulating, since it implicitly refers backwards to all the studies that, at least starting from the Logical Investigations, have been devoted to the relationship between sensible experience and predicative thought.


The project of a new transcendental logic is here considered as equivalent to the overall project of the transcendental phenomenology. Transcendental logic, indeed, defines the logic of the world, such as it is given in and through lived experience. Consistently, it entails all material a priori disciplines, which are part of the full ontology of the world, and investigates the dynamics of the constitutive relationship between subjectivity and the world. Transcendental logic, in other words, defines an encompassing and complex theory of the different layers of experience, constitution, and cognition.


The transcendental aesthetic is located at the bottom of such a universal logic of the absolute science: it defines the most fundamental layer, the Grundstufe, of the transcendental-phenomenological theory of experience as a complex and unitary whole. The underlying idea in this presentation, thus, is that experience makes up a stratified unity, whereby the lower levels can be said to be founding with respect to the higher ones, since the former can subsist without the latter but not the other way around. Transcendental logic, then, has a twofold task: on the one hand, to demonstrate that between the logos of sensibility and the logos of predicative thought there is a foundational relationship, which allows us to talk about the one presupposing
the other; on the other, to show how predicative and scientific thought develops out of the basic layer of sensible experience.


Having said this, we can easily understand why the transcendental aesthetic is, in the following passage, described as laying the foundations for the architectonics of all a priori sciences engaged with a descriptive and transcendental inquiry into the world and its display to the experiencing subject: “Transcendental aesthetic” – in a new sense of the phrase (which we use because of an easily apprehensible relationship to Kant’s narrowly restricted transcendental aesthetic) functions as the ground level <in a world-logic>. It deals with the eidetic problem of any possible world as world given in “pure experience” and thus precedes all science in the “higher” sense; accordingly it undertakes the eidetic description of the allembracing Apriori, without which no Objects could appear unitarily in mere experience, prior to categorial actions (in our sense, which must not be confounded with the categorial in the Kantian sense), and therefore without which the unity of a Nature, the unity of a world as a passively synthetized unity could not become constituted at all. One stratum of that Apriori is the aesthetic Apriori of spatio-temporality. Naturally this logos of the aesthetic world, like the analytic logos, cannot become a genuine science without an investigation of transcendental constitution – and even from the constitutional investigation required here an exceedingly rich (and difficult) science accrues.


two keystones of Husserl’s transcendental aesthetic: the concept of the world and the notion of pure experience [ reine Erfahrung].


It is not by chance that Husserl puts the latter notion in inverted commas. Taken in correlation with the concept of the world, indeed, this notion implicitly refers to one of the primal sources of Husserl’s transcendental aesthetic, namely empirio-criticism, and particularly the theory of experience developed by Avenarius. In this chapter, the relevance of Husserl’s appraisal of Avenarius’s work for the shape given to his own transcendental aesthetic will be highlighted. In the first part, I introduce the crucial moments in Avernarius’s thought that are of relevance for Husserl’s transcendental aesthetic and I subsequently discuss Husserl’s appraisal of the theory. This will allow me, in the second part, to more directly address Husserl’s own project of the transcendental aesthetic, both in continuity and in dissociation with Avenarius’s theory of pure experience.


(1) the scope of the transcendental aesthetic and its relation to spatiality and temporality; (2) the stratification of experience; (3) the problem of facticity.


one of the most famous texts by Avenarius is precisely entitled Critique of Pure Experience [ Kritik der reinen Erfahrung].


Clearly evoking Kant’s critical enterprise, this work significantly transposes the focus of the critique from “pure reason” to “pure experience”. Arguments explaining both the meaning and the implications of this conceptual change can be found in the preface of the book. Differently from Kant’s first Critique, which explores the scope and the limits of reason’s cognitive power, Avenarius’s critical enterprise sets up its tribunal to establish the rights of all scientific and philosophical interpretations of experience.


the critique is supposed not to make reference to any philosophical or scientific explanations, but rather to directly tie up with things themselves (Avenarius 1888, pp. X; XIII). The Husserlian reader cannot but be impressed by these words, which immediately call to mind the phenomenological motto: “We must go back to the ‘things themselves’”. The affinity in the programmatic mottos, indeed, testifies at least to a common idea of the object of philosophy and its aims. For both Avenarius and Husserl, the basis of all philosophical inquiries has to be experience in its different manifestations. Accordingly, the primal aim of philosophy is to provide an account of experience in a straightforward way, i.e., independently of all philosophical or scientific interpretations that have progressively covered it up.


Consistently with this fundamental assumption, Avenarius formulates the two axioms of empirio-criticism: (1) as opposed to the presumptive original truths of philosophical and metaphysical claims, the first axiom purports the necessity to return to the primal experience that every individual has of his/her surrounding [ Umgebung]; (2) as opposed to the presumptive superiority of the natural sciences in giving access to truth, the second axiom assumes such scientific theories as being nothing but further elaborations of pre-scientific experiential knowledge (Avenarius 1888, p. VII).


The first point to be discussed is, precisely, the notion of pure experience, which is addressed in the introduction to the Critique of Pure Experience. Here, both a synthetic and an analytic definition of pure e
